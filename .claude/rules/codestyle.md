# Codestyle Rules

1. **Avoid plan specific comments** such as Phase 1, Step 1, or Gap #3 which reflect planning details but don't aid code comprehension.
2. Use `enum class` preferentially for basic enumeration usage. Use `enum` only when implementing bitmask patterns or when bitwise operations are required.

    **Good:**

    ```cpp
    enum class CoreType : int { AIC = 0, AIV = 1 };
    CoreType type = CoreType::AIC;
    ```

    **Bad (unless implementing bitmask):**

    ```cpp
    enum CoreType { AIC = 0, AIV = 1 };  // Avoid this for basic enums
    ```

3. Prefer `volatile` decorator on struct members rather than volatile pointer casts unless necessary.
4. Avoid using pointer arithmetic with hardcoded offsets when `offsetof` is available.
5. **Never use `std::this_thread::yield()` or `sched_yield()` in AICPU spin-wait loops.** On the Ascend AICPU, yielding to the OS scheduler introduces unacceptable latency for tight spin-waits (ticket locks, CAS retries, etc.). Use an empty loop body or a bare architecture hint (`__asm__ volatile("yield")`) instead.
6. **For cross-platform/platform-isolation preprocessor blocks, place the `__aarch64__` branch first.** Use this ordering pattern:

    ```cpp
    #if defined(__aarch64__)
    // aarch64 path (must be first)
    #elif defined(__x86_64__)
    // x86_64 path
    #else
    // other platforms
    #endif
    ```

7. **Never log on AICPU hot paths** (orchestrator / scheduler inner loops,
   per-task or per-scope code such as `submit_task` / `begin_scope` / the
   dispatch loop). AICPU `device_log` writes are expensive and serialize on the
   single AICPU op; flooding them — e.g. one `LOG_*` per scope_begin or per task
   — slows the op enough to trip the **op-execute timeout** (STARS/tsdaemon
   `HandleTaskTimeout` kills `aicpu-sd`), which *masks the very behavior you were
   trying to observe* and looks like a runtime hang. Gate any diagnostic to a
   high-water-mark (log only on a new max), a sample interval, or the
   cold/stall path — never unconditionally per iteration.
