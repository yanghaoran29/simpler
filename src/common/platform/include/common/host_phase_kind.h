/**
 * The kinds a HostPhaseRecord can be — the vocabulary alone, with no dependency
 * beyond <cstdint>.
 *
 * Separate from chip_swimlane_profiling.h, which owns the record, the pools and the
 * drain machinery, because those need <vector> and the platform config while three
 * translation units need only the kinds:
 *
 *   - the host trace and record store, which format and file the records;
 *   - host_build_graph/host/orchestrator.cpp, which raises the kinds but needs
 *     none of the record machinery;
 *   - orchestration_api.h, compiled into the orchestration .so, where the
 *     platform's host headers are absent.
 *
 * So keep this header free of anything the orchestration .so cannot take — no STL
 * containers, no platform types. HostPhaseRecord stores a kind as a plain
 * uint32_t, so it does not depend on this header either way.

 * orchestrator kinds are nested inside BindHostOrch and overlap each other, some
 * being sub-operations of others. Each kind is recorded at exactly one site,
 * named beside it.
