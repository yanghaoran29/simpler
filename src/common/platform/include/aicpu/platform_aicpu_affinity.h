// Upper bound on AICPU gate threads / slots, and the size of the
// `aicpu_allowed_cpus[]` table the host writes into Runtime. Single source of
// truth: the filter gate barriers/classifies at most this many threads, and
// `allowed_count` (the number of survivor cpu_ids) is bounded by it — so the
// Runtime ABI array must be exactly this long. Keep the runtime structs and
// the gate in lockstep by referencing this constant instead of a literal.
constexpr int32_t MAX_GATE_THREADS = 16;

// Returns true if this thread should call aicpu_execute().
// Returns false if this thread should exit (dropped).
// logical_count: desired active threads (from runtime.aicpu_thread_num)
// total_launched: actual threads launched (PLATFORM_MAX_AICPU_LAUNCH_THREADS)

// Filter-style affinity gate. Every launched thread reads sched_getcpu(),
// barriers, and the gate keeps exactly those whose cpu_id appears in
// `allowed_cpus[0..allowed_count-1]`. The deterministic survivor index
// (its position in `allowed_cpus`) is exposed through
// platform_aicpu_affinity_thread_idx() and drives role assignment
// downstream (sched / orch).
//
// Convention used by tensormap_and_ringbuffer: indices 0..allowed_count-2
// are scheduler slots, index allowed_count-1 is the orchestrator slot. The
// host builds `allowed_cpus` from platform topology/OCCUPY and passes the
// array down through the Runtime struct.
//
// total_launched is the number of AICPU threads CANN actually launched
// (PLATFORM_MAX_AICPU_LAUNCH_THREADS on the target arch); the
// gate stops exactly that many threads on its barrier and lets only the
// allowed_count survivors continue.

// platform_aicpu_affinity_gate_filter() invocation on this thread.

// gate.

// N-1).

// Onboard, the filter gate already assigns the index, so this is a redundant
// (same-value) store. Sim's basic gate does NOT assign an exec index, so
// platform_aicpu_affinity_thread_idx() would return -1 inside the AICPU `.so`;
// the executor resolves the real index (via its own fallback counter) and
// publishes it here so every per-thread reader in the `.so` agrees — in
// particular the per-thread AICPU phase-record slot
// (aicpu_phase_self_records()), which otherwise has no valid index on sim and
// drops every sub-phase stamp. Must be called on the executing thread, before
// any phase stamping.
