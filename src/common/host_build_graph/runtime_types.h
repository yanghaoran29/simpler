// Task management
//
// The task table is a flat array of slots, indexed directly by local task id:
// ids start at 0, are never recycled, and alloc() caps them at the table's size,
// so there is no wrap and no slot mask. The size need not be a power of two —
// nothing masks with it.
//
// This is the default; `CallConfig.runtime_env.ring_task_window` overrides it per
// task. The host mirror is allocated at whatever size is in effect and committed
// by first touch, so a run pays only for the slots and argument-pool bytes it
// actually writes. Raising it costs virtual address space, bounded by the int32
// reach of a payload's self-relative region deltas (checked in
// SharedMemoryHandle::init).
#define CHIP_DEFAULT_GRAPH_TASKS 16384

// host_build_graph carries no per-scope-depth task partition: host-orch builds
// the whole graph on the host and the device runs it once without reclaim. tmr's
// multi-ring design existed only to let inner scopes reclaim independently under
// small rings; with no reclaim and a whole-graph-resident task table, per-depth
// isolation is moot. The RuntimeEnv ABI still carries RUNTIME_ENV_RING_COUNT
// slots because it is shared with tmr; this runtime reads none of them and warns
// when one is set (see bind_callable_to_runtime_impl).

// Graph recording takes everything above.

/**
 * Task state enumeration
 *
 * State transitions (strictly linear, values ordered so readers can use
 * ordered comparisons: `>= CHIP_TASK_PUBLISHED` asks "every block placed?",
 * `>= CHIP_TASK_COMPLETED` asks "every subtask finished?"):
 *   PENDING -> PUBLISHED -> COMPLETED
 *
 * The task stays in PENDING from submit through "ready in queue" and "running
 * on a worker": readiness comes from the producers' completion state, and
 * running-vs-idle from the per-core running_slot_state -- neither from this
 * field. Which completion state carries readiness depends on the task's id
 * space; see ChipTaskSlotState below.
 *
 * Conditions:
 *   PENDING->PUBLISHED:   every logical block's payload + MMIO token is
 *                         written (placement, not launch). Only the SM
 *                         task_states byte of an ED_FLAG_TRACKED task takes
 *                         this value; the slot-resident mirror never does.
 *   ->COMPLETED:          all subtasks finish (set by scheduler) or task is a
 *                         hidden alloc completed inline by the orchestrator.
 *                         Completion implies publication (a finished task
 *                         occupies no cores), so COMPLETED > PUBLISHED.
 *
 * COMPLETED is terminal: no slot is recycled before the run ends, so nothing
 * advances a task past it.

/**
 * Per-task slot scheduling state. Only the scheduler mutates it, but it lives
 * wherever its ChipTaskStorage does: the SM image's storage segment for a
 * GLOBAL task, the GraphExecution image for an IN_GRAPH one.
 *
 * 64 bytes = one cache line. Under the polling completion model a task's
 * readiness is derived from its producers' completion state; producer completion
 * is published by marking this task complete + draining its wake list. There is
 * no fanout adjacency, refcount, or per-task lock here.
 *
 * Which field carries that completion state depends on which task table the slot
 * belongs to, and both are load-bearing:
 *
 *   - A GLOBAL task holds a slot in the SM task table, so its readiness truth is
 *     `task_states[local_id]` — a byte-per-slot array, which is what lets a
 *     fanin scan read many producers out of one cache line. `task_state` is then
 *     a mirror, read only by the cold-path stall dump.
 *   - An IN_GRAPH task lives in its Graph's own storage and has no slot in that
 *     table, hence no byte there. `task_state` IS its readiness truth, read on
 *     the device by graph_first_unmet_producer; only the outer Graph shell (a
 *     GLOBAL task) gets its byte advanced when the body finishes.
 *
 * So a completion publishes both for a GLOBAL task and `task_state` alone for an
 * IN_GRAPH one. `task_state` itself only ever holds PENDING or COMPLETED; the
 * PUBLISHED middle value exists in the task_states array alone.
