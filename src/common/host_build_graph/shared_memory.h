/**
 * Shared Memory Layout
 *
 * Defines the shared memory structure for Orchestrator-Scheduler communication.
 *
 * Memory Layout:
 *   +---------------------------+
 *   | SharedMemoryHeader        |  (task count + segment pointers + scheduler error state)
 *   +---------------------------+
 *   | ChipTaskStorage[]         |  (descriptor + slot state + payload, per task)
 *   | std::atomic<ChipTaskState>[] |  (progress state, one byte per task)
 *   +---------------------------+
 *   | fanin / tensor / scalar   |  (the argument pools payloads name by delta)
 *   +---------------------------+
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Only data needed for Orchestrator<->Scheduler communication is here
 * - TensorMap, scope_stack and ready_queues are in private memory
 * - Synchronization via atomic counters/flags (no locks needed for single-word R/W)
 *
 * Based on: docs/RUNTIME_LOGIC.md

//     own address; the restack changed those distances, so every one is re-taken
//     against the image. A region keeps its position within its pool, so the re-take
//     is the same arithmetic with the image's bases. A task's own three records need
//     no such re-take: they share one ChipTaskStorage, so their distances are that
//     type's layout and the change of pitch cannot reach them;
//   - every heap address the orchestrator wrote is in the HEAP_VIRTUAL_BASE window,
//     so `rebase` moves it onto the device region committed after orchestration.
//     Three fields carry one: a descriptor's packed buffer bounds (read on the
//     device by the Graph expansion in graph_execution.cpp), a payload's dispatch
//     predicate (dereferenced by the scheduler), and a tensor argument's buffer
//     address — the last one per task and in that task's own element type, since an
//     outer GRAPH task's boundaries are GraphTensors rather than ChipTensors.
//
// Those three are the whole surface: a heap address that reached the device through
// an untyped channel would not be moved, and the scalar pool cannot be swept for
