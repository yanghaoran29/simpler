// arrays one per scalar argument (CORE_MAX_SCALAR_ARGS), and predicates at
// most one per task.
//
// internal_fanins is the one array left growing, and the reason is the size it grows to
// rather than the bound it could reach. It has no per-in-graph-task cap: CHIP_MAX_FANIN
// bounds a global task's inline fanin, but an in-graph task's producers travel in the
// Definition's own CSR, which the scheduler reads directly, so the only limits are uint16
// producer indices and each producer being an earlier task of the same body — a structural
// 1024 x 1023 / 2 edges, 4.2 MB.

// crosses glibc's mmap threshold, since a freed block below it is reused off the heap

// thread for it would be sizing an array to a worst case, which is the opposite of what
// the reservations above do. Re-decide this with a measurement if a workload's bodies ever
// get dense enough to push it past ~128 KB.
