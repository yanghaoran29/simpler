/**
 * The `hbg` runtime's task handle and the layout it encodes into one.
 *
 * The layout is private to this runtime. `tmr` has its own TaskId, encoding a ring
 * slot in the same 64 bits (src/common/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/task_id.h). The two
 * are distinct types in distinct namespaces, and a translation unit sees exactly one
 * of them. Nothing in the include path enforces that — src/common is on every
 * target's — so the trailing using-declaration does: reaching both headers from one
 * scope is a compile error, not a silent bind to whichever came first.

     * Which id space a task id belongs to, held in the high 32 bits.
     *
     * Everything this runtime schedules is a task. The high bits say whether a task
     * belongs to a Graph task or stands on its own, which is also what decides where
     * its id resolves:
     *
     *   GLOBAL   — a task of the run itself, holding a slot in the shared-memory task
     *              table. Its low bits are the task allocator's local id, resolvable
     *              via get_slot_by_task_id().
     *   IN_GRAPH — a task belonging to one Graph task's body. It lives in that Graph's
     *              own storage, not in the task table, so its low bits are the packed
     *              pair below and must never be resolved against a table slot.
     *
     * An IN_GRAPH id is minted twice for the same task, in two disjoint scopes. The
     * recorder mints one per task it records, with `graph_task_id` fixed at 0: a
     * Definition is shared by every shell that replays it, so record time has no
     * single Graph task to name, and the low field is then the in-graph local id alone —
     * which is what keeps it inside the task chains the recording's hazard map is
     * dimensioned for. Materialize mints the other, with the replaying shell's real
     * local id. The two never meet: a recorded id lives only in the recorder thread's
     * private map and the body's own locals, and a materialized task is addressed by
     * index rather than looked up by id.
