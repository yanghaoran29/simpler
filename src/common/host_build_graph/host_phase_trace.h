 *
 * It is one number rather than a size per buffer because the ends have to agree:
 * a caller formats its own attributes, `record_bind_phase` appends this thread's
 * fault and context-switch deltas, the store copies the result in with
 * `snprintf`, and the logger copies it once more into the span's attribute
 * field — every one of those truncates in silence. Nine separate literals cannot
 * state that relationship, and the widest of them was already larger than the
 * store.
 *
 * It is the span field's own width, so the value the logger receives always
 * fits and its own `~` marker never fires. `record_bind_phase` therefore marks
 * its own truncation: without that, an overlong attribute list would arrive
 * looking complete and one field short.

 *   - **Per-kind counters**, owned here. They produce the `LOG_TIMING`

 *     the channel that works at `--rounds > 1`, where the artifact collectors are
 *     switched off entirely.
 *   - **The platform's host phase pool**, when a per-event reader is enabled.
 *     Records go straight into platform-allocated memory (see
 *     host/host_phase_records.h); this runtime holds only the pool pointer.
 *
 * Timestamps are host monotonic nanoseconds — the clock the `[STRACE]` host
 * spans use — so records nest inside `chip.run.bind` with no alignment step
 * and share the enclosing run's (pid, inv) identity.
