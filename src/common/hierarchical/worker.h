/**
 * Worker — top-level distributed worker node.
 *
 * Worker is the implementation of one level in the hierarchy (L3, L4, …).
 * It contains the full scheduling engine (TensorMap, Allocator, Scope,
 * Orchestrator, Scheduler) and a set of sub-workers (each a forked Python
 * child reachable via a shared-memory mailbox) it dispatches to.
 *
 * Public surface:
 *   - add_worker(type, mailbox)    — register a sub-worker (before init).
 *                                    `mailbox` is a MAILBOX_SIZE-byte
 *                                    MAP_SHARED region; the real worker
 *                                    (a `ChipWorker` for NEXT_LEVEL, a
 *                                    Python callable for SUB) lives in
 *                                    the forked child.
 *   - init() / close()             — lifecycle
 *   - get_orchestrator()           — accessor used by the Python facade
 *                                    (scope_begin / drain / scope_end live
 *                                     on the Orchestrator, not here)
 *
 * Worker holds no submit / scope / drain / active-task bookkeeping — those
 * concepts belong to Orchestrator.
 *
 * Construction is separated from `init()` so Python callers can mmap the
 * HeapRing in the parent process *before* forking children (children see the
 * MAP_SHARED region at the same virtual address). Start the scheduler and
 * WorkerThreads with `init()` only after forks have happened.
