 *     at kernel entry; queried via `is_l2_swimlane_enabled()`.
 *   - granular L2SwimlaneLevel — `L2SwimlaneDataHeader::l2_swimlane_level`
 *     (shared memory); read in `l2_swimlane_aicpu_init` and cached, then queried
 *     via `get_l2_swimlane_level()` for
 *     `>= AICPU_TIMING / SCHED_PHASES / ORCH_PHASES` gates.

 * Pre-dispatch hook for AICore buffer rotation and per-pool stats.
 *
 * Called from the dispatch path (scheduler_dispatch in tensormap_and_ringbuffer,
 * aicpu_executor in host_build_graph) immediately BEFORE `write_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)`
 * for each AICore task. Two responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. Maintain the per-core AICPU-side dispatch count.
 *   2. Rotate the AICore buffer when the count is about to cross a
 *      PLATFORM_AICORE_BUFFER_SIZE boundary — publish the next buffer from
 *      free_queue to AICore and STASH the just-filled buffer for deferred,
 *      ACK-gated release (see l2_swimlane_aicpu_on_aicore_ack).
 *   3. Bump the AICore pool's `total_record_count` so host reconcile
 *      (total == collected + dropped) stays accurate at all levels —
 *      including AICORE_TIMING (level=1), where `complete_task` is bypassed.
 *
 * Race safety: rotation runs BEFORE the dispatch register write. The
 * completion-before-dispatch invariant proves prior tasks FIN'd, but
 * tensormap_and_ringbuffer writes FIN before the swimlane record, so the old
 * buffer's tail record may not have drained at rotation time. The old buffer is
 * therefore not enqueued here; it is released once AICore ACKs the boundary
 * dispatch (whose token is `reg_task_id`). host_build_graph writes the record
 * before FIN so it has no such window and need not wire the ACK hook.
 *
 * No-op if l2_swimlane is disabled or `core_id` is out of range.
 *
 * @param core_id      Core index this dispatch targets
 * @param thread_idx   Owning AICPU thread (target ready-queue for rotation)

 * first-task ACK — hence passed the old buffer's last record dcci+dsb — so the
 * stashed buffer is enqueued to the ready queue. No-op when nothing is stashed
 * or the token does not match the gate. Only tensormap_and_ringbuffer wires
