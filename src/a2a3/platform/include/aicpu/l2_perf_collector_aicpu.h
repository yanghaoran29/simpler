 * state without reaching into the generic `Runtime` struct.

 * Two-channel level transport (mirrors the PMU pattern):
 *   - binary on/off — `enable_profiling_flag` bit1 → `set_l2_swimlane_enabled(bool)`
 *     at kernel entry; queried via `is_l2_swimlane_enabled()`.
 *   - granular L2PerfLevel — `L2PerfDataHeader::l2_perf_level`
 *     (shared memory); read in `l2_perf_aicpu_init` and cached, then queried
 *     via `get_l2_perf_level()` for
 *     `>= AICPU_TIMING / SCHED_PHASES / ORCH_PHASES` gates.
