/**
 * Record task execution performance data.
 *
 * AICore writes a slim L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskRecord into its currently-published
 * per-core L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskBuffer at `records[slot_within_buf++]`. The
 * publication channel is an L2SwimlaneActiveHead cache line addressed via
 * `KernelArgs::l2_swimlane_aicore_rotation_table[block_idx]` (points to the
 * AICore pool's `head`, not directly to a buffer). AICPU updates
 * `head->current_buf_ptr` and bumps `head->current_buf_seq` at dispatch
 * boundaries; AICore detects the change by `dcci`-ing the head line per task
 * and comparing the sequence to its locally cached copy.
 *
 * AICPU and AICore never read each other's data on the hot path. The host
 * post-processor joins the AICore stream (multi-buffer per core, in order)
 * with the AICPU stream by `reg_task_id` at flush time. See
 * `docs/dfx/l2-swimlane-profiling.md`.
 *
 * Race avoidance: AICPU rotates strictly before `write_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)`
 * for the first task of a new BUFFER_SIZE batch — driven by AICPU's own
 * per-core dispatch count (no AICore-side signal). At rotation AICPU only
 * publishes the new buffer; it does NOT hand the old buffer to the host there.
 * The completion-before-dispatch invariant proves all prior tasks FIN'd, but
 * this runtime writes FIN before the record below, so a FIN-gated release could
 * publish a buffer whose tail record's `dcci(record, CACHELINE_OUT) + dsb` has
 * not landed. AICPU instead releases the old buffer once it observes AICore ACK
 * the new buffer's first task (l2_swimlane_aicpu_on_aicore_ack): by this core's
 * single-threaded program order that ACK is emitted only after the previous
 * task's record dcci+dsb, so the old buffer's last record is guaranteed drained.
 *
 * @param head            Per-core L2SwimlaneActiveHead channel. The executor
 *                        resolves it right after Phase 1 handshake exit
 *                        (`aicpu_ready == 1`) via get_l2_swimlane_aicore_head(),
 *                        which dereferences the slot the kernel entry stashed
 *                        from KernelArgs::l2_swimlane_aicore_rotation_table[block_idx]
 *                        — by then AICPU's `l2_swimlane_aicpu_init` has
 *                        populated the slot.
 * @param local           Per-core AICore-local state (caller-owned static)
 * @param task_token_raw  Full task identity (PTO2 encoding for tensormap_and_ringbuffer
 *                        runtime: `(ring_id << 32) | local_id`; plain task index
 *                        zero-extended for host_build_graph). The caller in the
 *                        ringbuffer runtime reads this from
 *                        `exec_payload->local_context.async_ctx.task_token.raw`
 *                        which is already in AICore cache (it was just dcci'd for
 *                        the kernel call), so no extra GM load.
 * @param reg_task_id     Per-core dispatch token (low 32 bits of the per-core
 *                        monotonic dispatch_seq). Per-dispatch unique within
 *                        a core; serves as the host-side join key against the
 *                        AICPU record stream. Required because SPMD with
 *                        `block_num > num_cores` (and MIX cluster spread)
 *                        dispatch the same `task_token_raw` multiple times to
 *                        the same core — each dispatch needs its own AICore
 *                        record matched to its own AICPU record, which
 *                        task_token_raw alone cannot disambiguate.
 * @param receive_time    Timestamp captured immediately after `read_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)`
 *                        returns the new task_id (before dcci+ack). Stored as a
 *                        32-bit delta `start_time - receive_time` in the record;
 *                        host recovers `receive_time = start_time - delta`.
 *                        Lets DFX split head_OH into the unfixable
 *                        AICPU→AICore NoC propagation (dispatch_ts → receive_time)
 *                        and the AICore-local dcci+ack cost (receive_time → start_time).
 * @param start_time      Start timestamp (get_sys_cnt) — post-dcci+ack, just
 *                        before kernel `execute_task`.
 * @param end_time        End timestamp
