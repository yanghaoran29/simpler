/**
 * @file kernel_args.h
 * @brief KernelArgs payload - Shared between Host, AICPU, and AICore
 *
 * This structure is the Simpler runtime payload read by AICPU and AICore
 * kernels. It contains pointers to device memory for runtime data, profiling
 * buffers, and platform state.
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * - a2a3: Real hardware with CANN runtime compatibility
 * - a2a3sim: Host-based simulation using standard memory
 *
 * Memory Layout (a2a3):
 * This platform struct is the front-less per-task runtime payload, passed
 * directly to the onboard AICPU launch (rtsLaunchCpuKernel) and copied to
 * device memory for AICore — no CANN launch front is needed on this path.
 * The bootstrap dispatcher has its own private KernelArgs/DeviceArgs ABI in
 * src/common/aicpu_loader/device/aicpu_dispatcher.cpp.
 *
 * Memory Layout (a2a3sim):
 * For simulation, the layout is maintained for API compatibility, though
 * we use host memory instead of device memory.

/**
 * Kernel arguments payload
 *
 * This structure is the payload passed to AICPU kernels by the host and copied
 * to device memory for AICore kernels.
 *
 * Field Access Patterns:
 * - runtime_args: Written by host, read by AICPU (task runtime, includes
 *   handshake buffers)
 * - dump_data_base: Written by host, read by AICPU platform layer; zero when
 *   args dump is unused
 * - pmu_data_base: Written by host platform, read by AICPU platform layer;
 *   zero when PMU is unused
 * - dep_gen_data_base: Written by host platform, read by AICPU platform layer;
 *   zero when dep_gen capture is unused
 *
 * enable_profiling_flag bit definitions (umbrella bitmask — "profiling" is
 * the umbrella, each bit is a parallel diagnostics sub-feature):
 * - bit0: args dump enabled
 * - bit1: chip swimlane enabled
 * - bit2: PMU enabled
 * - bit3: dep_gen capture enabled
 *
 * Consumer paths:
 *       - AICPU: receives this KernelArgs directly via rtsLaunchCpuKernel
 *       - AICore: receives device KernelArgs* via KERNEL_ENTRY
