/**
 * @file kernel_args.h
 * @brief KernelArgs Structure - Shared between Host, AICPU, and AICore
 *
 * This structure is used to pass arguments to both AICPU and AICore kernels.
 * It contains pointers to device memory for arguments and runtime data.
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * - a2a3: Real hardware with CANN runtime compatibility
 * - a2a3sim: Host-based simulation using standard memory
 *
 * Memory Layout (a2a3):
 * This structure's layout is hardcoded in libaicpu_extend_kernels.so, which
 * expects specific offsets for deviceArgs fields. The unused[5] array provides
 * the required offset alignment for compatibility with the CANN runtime.
 *
 * Memory Layout (a2a3sim):
 * For simulation, the layout is maintained for API compatibility, though
 * we use host memory instead of device memory.

 * Kernel arguments structure
 *
 * This structure is passed to AICPU kernels by the host.
 *
 * Field Access Patterns:
 * - unused[5]: Padding for alignment with CANN runtime expectations
 * - device_args: Written by host, read by AICPU (contains aicpu_so_bin/aicpu_so_len)
 * - runtime_args: Written by host, read by AICPU (task runtime, includes
 *   handshake buffers)
 * - dump_data_base: Written by host, read by AICPU platform layer; zero when
 *   tensor dump is unused
 *
 * Field Access Patterns:
 *       - AICPU: receives KernelArgs* via DynTileFwkBackendKernelServer
 *       - AICore: receives KernelArgs* via KERNEL_ENTRY
