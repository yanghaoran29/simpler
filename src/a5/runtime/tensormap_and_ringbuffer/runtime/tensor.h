// it, so kernels and the orchestration sources shared between runtimes name this
// rather than picking one — several are compiled under both.
//
// The name is unqualified because nothing on a kernel or orchestration include path
// reaches task_interface/buffer.h, which declares a different `Tensor` — the L3+
// wire form, at global scope. tests/lint/check_kernel_wire_isolation.py holds that
// separation; an include that breaks it turns this line into a redeclaration.
