/**
 * Runtime core interface
 *
 * This is the main header for the runtime.
 * It provides a unified API for task graph construction and execution.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Bump-allocated task table and graph heap (zero allocation overhead)
 * - Lazy invalidation TensorMap for dependency discovery
 * - Manual scopes that bypass TensorMap discovery for explicit dependencies
 * - Per-task spinlocks for concurrent fanout updates
 * - Orchestrator-Scheduler decoupling via shared memory
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Create runtime: RuntimeContext create methods
 *   2. Build task graph in orchestration function:
 *      - begin_scope() / end_scope()
 *      - submit_task()
 *   3. Mark orchestration complete: mark_done()
 *   4. Destroy runtime
 *
 * Based on: docs/RUNTIME_LOGIC.md
