/**
 * @file memory_barrier.h
 * @brief Memory barrier definitions for shared memory synchronization
 *
 * This header provides platform-specific memory barrier macros for
 * synchronizing shared memory accesses between Host, AICPU, and AICore.
 *
 * Memory barriers ensure that:
 * - Read barriers (rmb): All reads before the barrier complete before any reads after
 * - Write barriers (wmb): All writes before the barrier complete before any writes after
 *
 * These are critical for correct operation of lock-free data structures
 * and shared memory protocols across different processing units.
