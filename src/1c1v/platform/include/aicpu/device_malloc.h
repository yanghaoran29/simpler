 * Provides device-side memory allocation functions that work on both

 * simulation (using standard malloc/free).
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * - a2a3: Real hardware with HAL memory API (halMemAlloc/halMemFree)
 * - a2a3sim: Host-based simulation using malloc/free

 * address space as AICPU-local malloc().
 *
 * On a2a3sim: Allocates host heap memory via malloc(). In simulation, all
