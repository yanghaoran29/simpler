/**
 * @file pto2_dispatch_payload.h
 * @brief Per-core dispatch payload for AICore kernel execution
 *
 * PTO2DispatchPayload holds the kernel function address, a per-core args[]
 * array, and embedded SPMD context (LocalContext + GlobalContext).  AICPU
 * maintains a static array of these (one per core).
 *
 * GlobalContext (sub_block_id) is initialized once at runtime startup via
 * init_global_context() and never modified afterwards.
 *
 * LocalContext (block_idx, block_num) and args[] are rebuilt by build_payload()
 * before each dispatch.  Both context struct pointers are written into the
 * args[] suffix on every dispatch (since args[] is rebuilt entirely each time).
 *
 * AICore caches a pointer to its per-core slot at startup and reads from
 * it on each dispatch.  The struct is cache-line aligned to avoid false
 * sharing across concurrently dispatched cores.
 *
 * The DATA_MAIN_BASE register protocol is unchanged from the base runtime:
 * a monotonically increasing reg_task_id signals new work to AICore.
