 * simulation (using standard malloc/free).
 *
 * Platform Support:
 * - a2a3: Real hardware with HAL memory API (halMemAlloc/halMemFree)
 * - a2a3sim: Host-based simulation using malloc/free

 * device virtual address accessible by AIV/AIC cores. This is NOT the same
 * address space as AICPU-local malloc().
 *
 * On a2a3sim: Allocates host heap memory via malloc(). In simulation, all
 * address spaces are shared, so this is equivalent to regular malloc.
