# Profiling Framework

Shared host-side infrastructure that the PMU, L2Swimlane, DepGen,
TensorDump, and ScopeStats collectors are built on. The framework headers
live in
[`src/common/platform/include/host/`](../src/common/platform/include/host/)
and are consumed verbatim by both a2a3 and a5 collectors (PR #944
unified the previously-divergent per-arch copies into one set). This page
describes the shape; §8 covers the a5-specific transport deviations that
the collectors themselves still carry.

The per-collector pages
([pmu-profiling.md](dfx/pmu-profiling.md),
[l2-swimlane-profiling.md](dfx/l2-swimlane-profiling.md),
[dep_gen.md](dfx/dep_gen.md),
[args-dump.md](dfx/args-dump.md),
[scope-stats.md](dfx/scope-stats.md))
describe the data each subsystem collects and how it enables it on-device.

For everyday per-run timing (no collector, always on under `SIMPLER_PROFILING`):
[l2-timing.md](dfx/l2-timing.md) covers host_wall / device_wall (`[STRACE]` markers) +
device-log Orch/Sched/Total, and [host-trace.md](dfx/host-trace.md) +
[device-phases.md](dfx/device-phases.md) cover the `[STRACE]` per-stage
breakdown of `simpler_run` (host stages + AICPU phase subdivision).

## 1. Why a shared framework

Each profiling subsystem needs the same plumbing on the host:

- A management path that polls the AICPU's per-thread SPSC ready queues
  and recycles full buffers back to the device while kernels are still
  running. A module may opt into split drain/refill threads plus a
  replenish thread.
- Collector thread shards that drain host-side hand-off queues and copy
  records out of each ready buffer.
- A pool of pre-registered device buffers (allocated up-front, refilled on
  demand) keyed by "kind". PMU, DepGen, TensorDump, and ScopeStats have one
  kind; L2Swimlane has four.
- A dev↔host pointer map so the management thread can resolve a device
  pointer popped off a ready queue to the host-mapped pointer the collector
  thread will read.
- A teardown sequence that flushes the device queues and host shards without
  losing late entries.

Before unification this was near-identical control flow repeated across
collectors. The framework collapses it to one implementation parameterized
on a small per-subsystem trait.

## 2. Layered view

`ProfilerBase` is the owner: it holds `BufferPoolManager manager_` as a
member, spawns and joins the mgmt / collector threads, and dispatches
collected buffers to
`Derived::on_buffer_collected` via CRTP. `BufferPoolManager` owns no
threads — it is just the shared data structure both threads access.
`Module` is a stateless trait that tells the generic algorithms how the
subsystem's shared-memory layout is shaped.

## 3. The three roles

### 3.1 `BufferPoolManager<Module>` — data layer

Defined in [`buffer_pool_manager.h`](../src/common/platform/include/host/buffer_pool_manager.h).
Owns:

- `ready_shards_` — mgmt → collector hand-off shards, each guarded by
  mutex+cv.
- `done_shards_` — collector → mgmt recycle shards, each guarded by mutex.
- `recycled_[shard][kind]` — shard-local pool of free device buffers,
  guarded by one mutex per shard/kind.
- `dev_to_host_` — single source of truth for `resolve_host_ptr`.
- `MemoryOps` — type-erased `alloc / reg / free_` callbacks, plus the
  `shared_mem_host` and `device_id` stashed once at start.

Owns no threads. Every entry point is documented as one of:

- mgmt-only or internally locked (`drain_done_into_recycled`, recycled
  pool ops),
- collector-only (`notify_copy_done`, one shard per collector),
- shared with internal locking (`push_to_ready` / `wait_pop_ready` /
  `try_pop_ready`),
- start/stop-only (`set_memory_context`, `release_owned_buffers`,
  `clear_mappings`).

### 3.2 `ProfilerBase<Derived, Module>` — control layer

Defined in [`profiler_base.h`](../src/common/platform/include/host/profiler_base.h).
Provides:

- The mgmt thread(s), collector thread(s), and their lifecycle (`start` /
  `stop`).
- Split mgmt threads — `mgmt_drain_loop` drains ready queues and refills the
  originating free queue from the current drain shard's local recycled pool
  (`ProfilerAlgorithms<Module>::process_entry` per popped entry), while
  `mgmt_replenish_loop` only drains done buffers into shard-local recycled
  pools. A one-shot `proactive_replenish` seeds every free queue before the
  threads start. Split drain threads do not bulk-mirror the whole
  shared-memory region; they refresh only their queue indices / entries
  before advancing `queue_heads`. On an empty scan, split drain does a short
  busy-poll window before falling back to the 10 us sleep, so micro-bursts
  are less likely to miss AICPU's bounded wait window.
- Optional collector sharding (`Module::kCollectorThreadCount`) — each
  collector drains one host ready shard and returns finished buffers through
  the matching done shard.
- `poll_and_collect_loop` — per-shard `wait_pop_ready` with a 100 ms cv
  tick, dispatches to `Derived::on_buffer_collected`, then calls
  `manager_.notify_copy_done(...)` itself; idle-timeout hang detector.
- `set_memory_context` / `clear_memory_context` so `Derived::init` can
  stash the alloc/reg/free callbacks before threads start; if init aborts
  before stashing, `start(tf)` becomes a no-op.

`ProfilerAlgorithms<Module>` (in the same
[profiler_base.h](../src/common/platform/include/host/profiler_base.h))
is where the unified algorithms live:

- `try_pop_aicpu_entry` — barrier-correct head/tail advance over the
  per-thread ready queue, with a range-check guard against device-side
  corruption.
- `process_entry` — shard-local fallback (local recycled → local done →
  other recycled shard → alloc) to refill the originating free_queue until
  it is full or no buffer is available, then resolve host_ptr and push to
  ready.
- `proactive_replenish` — drain done, then top every (kind, instance)
  free queue up to `kSlotCount`, batch-allocating `batch_size(kind)`
  buffers when the recycled pool of a kind drains mid-fill so recovery
  from a double-empty condition takes one tick instead of N.

### 3.3 `Module` — trait layer

A stateless `struct` per subsystem (`PmuModule`, `L2SwimlaneModule`,
`DepGenModule`, `DumpModule`, `ScopeStatsModule`) that tells the generic
algorithms what the shared-memory layout looks like. The contract lives in the
docblock at the top of
[`profiler_base.h`](../src/common/platform/include/host/profiler_base.h);
the required members are:

| Member | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `using DataHeader / ReadyEntry / ReadyBufferInfo / FreeQueue` | Layout types |
| `kBufferKinds` | Number of buffer kinds inside each recycled shard |
| `kReadyQueueSize`, `kSlotCount` | AICPU ready queue / free queue depth |
| `kSubsystemName` | Tag used in framework log lines |
| `kMgmtDrainThreadCount` | Optional; number of mgmt drain shards (defaults to 1) |
| `kCollectorThreadCount` | Optional number of collector / host ready-queue shards |
| `refresh_replenish_metadata(mgr, header)` | Optional hook to refresh cached queue metadata before a replenish pass |
| `header_from_shm(void*) → DataHeader*` | Cast shared-memory base to header |
| `batch_size(int kind) → int` | Per-kind batch-alloc count |
| `resolve_entry(shm, header, q, entry) → optional<EntrySite>` | Map a popped ready entry to (kind, free_queue, buffer_size, partial info); return `nullopt` to drop |
| `for_each_instance(shm, header, cb)` | Enumerate every (kind, instance, FreeQueue*, buffer_size) for `proactive_replenish` |
| `kind_of(info) → int` | **Multi-kind only.** Tells the framework which recycled bin a finished buffer belongs to. Single-kind modules omit this; the framework passes 0 |

The Module structs are defined alongside their collectors in
[pmu_collector.h](../src/a2a3/platform/include/host/pmu_collector.h),
[l2_swimlane_collector.h](../src/common/platform/include/host/l2_swimlane_collector.h),
[dep_gen_collector.h](../src/common/platform/include/host/dep_gen_collector.h),
[tensor_dump_collector.h](../src/common/platform/include/host/tensor_dump_collector.h),
and
[scope_stats_collector.h](../src/common/platform/include/host/scope_stats_collector.h)
— each is a few dozen lines of static methods over the subsystem's own
`DataHeader` / ringbuffer types.

### 3.4 `Derived` — domain layer

Each collector inherits as `class XxxCollector : public ProfilerBase<XxxCollector, XxxModule>`
and only has to provide:

- `void on_buffer_collected(const ReadyBufferInfo& info)` — copy the
  records out of `info.host_buffer_ptr` and update collector-specific
  state (CSV row, in-memory aggregator, file writer thread, …). The
  framework calls `manager_.notify_copy_done(...)` afterwards; **Derived
  must not call it directly.**
- `static constexpr int kIdleTimeoutSec` — bound on no-progress idle in
  the collector loop. Use the subsystem's `PLATFORM_*_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
  constant.
- `static constexpr const char* kSubsystemName` — appears in the idle
  timeout log line (e.g. `"PMU"`, `"L2Swimlane"`, `"TensorDump"`).
- `init(...)` and `finalize(...)` — domain-specific setup/teardown.
  `init` must call `set_memory_context()` on the success path so
  `start(tf)` is not a no-op. `finalize` must release framework-owned
  buffers (`release_owned_buffers`) and drop the mapping table
  (`clear_mappings`).

## 4. End-to-end data flow

```text
  AICPU                       mgmt thread(s)                    collector shard(s)

                            try_pop_aicpu_entry(q)
                            process_entry:
                              pop local recycled / local done / alloc
                                (top up originating free_queue)
                              resolve_host_ptr
                              push_to_ready(shard q) ─────────► wait_pop_ready(q)
                                                                Derived::on_buffer_collected
                                                                  (copy records out)
                                                                notify_copy_done(q)
                            ◄────────────────────────────────── done shard q
                            (next tick) drain into recycled

                                          ▲
                                          │
                            split runtime replenish:
                            drain done into shard-local
                            recycled pools only.
```

The queue shards plus the shard-local recycled pools and the dev↔host map all
live in the single `BufferPoolManager` instance owned by `ProfilerBase`.
Each ready shard has one collector consumer; each done shard is written by
its matching collector and drained into the same recycled shard. Split drain
refills the originating free queue on the hot path; split replenish no longer
writes free queues at runtime.

## 5. Lifecycle

```text
  Derived::init(...)
    rtMalloc + register pre-allocated buffers
    register_mapping for each (dev, host) pair
    set_memory_context(alloc_cb, register_cb, free_cb, ud, shm_host, device_id)

  ProfilerBase::start(thread_factory)
    assemble MemoryOps from stashed callbacks (sim mode installs an
      identity reg wrapper so register == nullptr is supported uniformly)
    manager_.set_memory_context(ops, shm_host, device_id)
    spawn mgmt thread(s)    ← started first; mgmt writes host ready shards
    spawn collector thread(s)

    ... AICPU / AICore execute ...

  ProfilerBase::stop()
    mgmt_running_ = false
    join mgmt thread(s)     ← mgmt final-drain flushes the last entries into
                              ready shards before exiting
    execution_complete_ = true
    join collector thread(s)← each shard drains once more, then exits

  Derived::finalize(unregister, free)
    manager_.release_owned_buffers([&](void* p) { unregister + free })
    free buffers still held in collector-owned free_queues / current_buf_ptr
    manager_.clear_mappings()
    clear_memory_context()
```

The order in `stop()` is load-bearing: mgmt is joined **before**
`execution_complete_` is signalled so its final-drain output has a
consumer; collectors then drain and exit. On return all host shards are
empty and `on_buffer_collected` has been called for every entry that was in
any shard.

`Derived::finalize` is responsible for the buffers the collector still
owns at stop time (`free_queue` slots and `current_buf_ptr`); the
framework only releases what it had in recycled / done / ready. This
split matters because the AICPU may still be referencing free-queue
buffers via shared memory until execution ends, so they cannot be freed
mid-run by the framework.

## 6. Concurrency invariants

| State | Reader(s) | Writer(s) | Synchronization |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| `ready_shards_[q]` | collector q | mgmt drain q | shard mutex + cv |
| `done_shards_[q]` | mgmt / replenish | collector q | shard mutex |
| `recycled_[shard][kind]` | drain shard / replenish | drain shard / replenish | shard/kind mutex |
| `dev_to_host_` | mgmt (`alloc_and_register`, `resolve_host_ptr`) | mgmt | `mapping_mutex_`; collector touches it only in `release_owned_buffers` / `clear_mappings`, after `stop()` has joined mgmt |
| `MemoryOps` / `shared_mem_host_` / `device_id_` | both threads | start-only | `set_memory_context` is called once before threads spawn; read-only afterwards |
| AICPU per-thread ready queues (`header->queues[q]`) | mgmt (head advance) | AICPU (tail advance) | `read_range_from_device` in split drain, then `write_range_to_device` for `queue_heads[q]` |
| Per-instance `FreeQueue` | AICPU (head advance) | mgmt (tail advance) | per-free-queue writer lock; host refreshes `head` before writing `buffer_ptrs[]` / `tail` |

Two things follow:

- `dev_to_host_` has a narrow mapping lock; recycled pools are split by
  collector shard and kind so the hot drain/refill path mostly stays local.
- Device-side queue backpressure is bounded for the profiling writers that
  use this protocol. If the host does not make ready-queue space or
  free-queue entries visible within the short wait budget, AICPU records a
  drop and keeps the workload moving instead of spinning indefinitely.
- The AICPU writer publishes a full buffer to the ready queue before
  acquiring its replacement buffer. If no replacement is visible yet, the
  current pointer is cleared and later records first try to recover from
  the free queue before counting a per-record drop. This matters under a
  one-buffer stress shape: the host cannot return a replacement until it
  first observes the full ready buffer.
- The mgmt thread must never zero AICPU-owned fields (`count`, `head`,
  `tail` on the AICPU side). The AICPU is the sole writer to those and
  resets them itself on flush/drop/pop.

## 7. Adding a new collector

1. Define the subsystem's shared-memory types (`DataHeader`,
   `ReadyQueueEntry`, `FreeQueue`, `ReadyBufferInfo`) somewhere both host
   and AICPU can include.
2. Write a `XxxModule` struct satisfying the contract in §3.3. Multi-kind
   modules also implement `kind_of`.
3. Write a `XxxCollector : public profiling_common::ProfilerBase<XxxCollector, XxxModule>`:
   - `init(...)`: `rtMalloc` + register pre-allocated buffers, populate
     the shared header, call `register_mapping` per buffer, then call
     `set_memory_context(...)`.
   - `on_buffer_collected(info)`: copy records out of
     `info.host_buffer_ptr`. **Do not** call `notify_copy_done`.
   - `kIdleTimeoutSec`, `kSubsystemName`.
   - `finalize(unregister, free)`: `release_owned_buffers` + free
     collector-owned buffers + `clear_mappings` + `clear_memory_context`.
4. Wire it into `device_runner` so `start(tf)` is called before the
   kernel launch and `stop()` before `finalize`.

Existing collectors are the canonical examples:

- [`PmuCollector`](../src/a2a3/platform/include/host/pmu_collector.h)
  — single kind, per-core instances. See [pmu-profiling.md](dfx/pmu-profiling.md).
- [`DepGenCollector`](../src/common/platform/include/host/dep_gen_collector.h)
  — single kind, one instance. See [dep_gen.md](dfx/dep_gen.md).
- [`TensorDumpCollector`](../src/common/platform/include/host/tensor_dump_collector.h)
  — single kind, per-AICPU-thread instances. See [args-dump.md](dfx/args-dump.md).
- [`ScopeStatsCollector`](../src/common/platform/include/host/scope_stats_collector.h)
  — single kind, one instance. See [scope-stats.md](dfx/scope-stats.md).
- [`L2SwimlaneCollector`](../src/common/platform/include/host/l2_swimlane_collector.h)
  — four kinds (AICPU task, scheduler phase, orchestrator phase, AICore
  task), per-core / per-thread instances; the canonical multi-kind example. See
  [l2-swimlane-profiling.md](dfx/l2-swimlane-profiling.md).

## 8. a5 specifics — host-shadow transport

a5's framework headers (under
[`src/common/platform/include/host/`](../src/common/platform/include/host/))
mirror a2a3's class shapes — same `ProfilerBase<Derived, Module>` /
`BufferPoolManager<Module>` / `ProfilerAlgorithms<Module>` decomposition,
same Module concept contract, same start/stop lifecycle. The only
behavioral deviation is the **transport channel**: a5 has no
`halHostRegister`, so device↔host synchronization goes through
`profiling_copy.h` (`rtMemcpy` onboard, `memcpy` in sim) against a
host-shadow `malloc()` paired with each device buffer. Three mechanical
changes capture that:

1. **`MemoryOps` carries 5 callbacks instead of 3.** In addition to
   `alloc` / `reg` / `free_`, a5 adds `copy_to_device` and
   `copy_from_device`. `reg` allocates the paired host shadow (instead of
   mapping a HAL view onto the device pointer); a default
   `default_host_shadow_register` (`malloc + memset 0 + copy_to_device`)
   is installed when the collector passes `nullptr` for `register_cb`.
2. **The mgmt loop mirrors the shm region into the host shadow per tick,
   then writes back only the fields it modified.** At the top of every
   tick the loop calls `manager_.mirror_shm_from_device()` to pull the
   `DataHeader` (with its `queue_tails`) and all `BufferState`s into the
   host shadow. As host advances `queue_heads[q]` or refills a
   `free_queue.tail` / `buffer_ptrs[slot]`, those individual fields are
   pushed back to device with `manager_.write_range_to_device(&field,
   sizeof(field))`. The bulk `mirror_shm_to_device` is deliberately
   **not** called from the mgmt loop — it would race with AICPU writes
   to device-only fields (`current_buf_ptr`, `total/dropped/mismatch`
   counters, `queue_tails`, `free_queue.head`,
   `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseHeader::magic`, `core_to_thread[]`), rolling them
   back to whatever the host shadow had at the start of the tick. Per-buffer
   payloads (`L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskBuffer` / `PmuBuffer` /
   `DumpMetaBuffer`) are still pulled on demand inside
   `ProfilerAlgorithms::process_entry` after resolving the host pointer
   for a popped ready entry. The bulk `mirror_shm_to_device` is kept
   for init/teardown where AICPU is not yet running or has exited.
3. **`release_owned_buffers` frees the paired host shadow.** When the
   framework recycles a device buffer at finalize time, it also frees the
   `malloc()`'d shadow tracked in `dev_to_host_`. `clear_mappings()` does
   the same for any remaining mappings (per-state buffers and the shm
   region itself).

Most collectors keep `reconcile_counters` passive — same shape as a2a3. It
pulls the post-`stop()` `BufferState`s, logs an error if any
`current_buf_ptr` still references a non-empty buffer (a device flush bug,
since AICPU is the only writer that can clear it), and runs the collector's
counter cross-check/accounting against device-side counters. TensorDump and
ScopeStats are the recovery-oriented exceptions: on abnormal exit they may
recover a non-empty `current_buf_ptr` host-side before export, so already
recorded dump metadata or scope samples still reach the output files.

### 8.1 Profiling state lives on `KernelArgs`, not `Handshake`

a5 carries the same "profiling out of the runtime synchronization protocol"
design as a2a3 (PR #714) plus the AICore-side rings of PR #709. The runtime
`Handshake` struct contains **no profiling fields** — enablement bits and
per-core ring/reg addresses travel through `KernelArgs`:

| `KernelArgs` field | Producer | Consumer |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| `enable_profiling_flag` (bitmask) | host (DeviceRunner) | AICPU `kernel.cpp` → `set_l2_swimlane_enabled` / `set_pmu_enabled` / `set_dump_args_enabled`; AICore `KERNEL_ENTRY` → `set_aicore_profiling_flag` |
| `aicore_l2_swimlane_ring_addrs` (table) | host (`L2SwimlaneCollector::initialize`) | AICore `KERNEL_ENTRY` indexes `table[block_idx]` → `set_aicore_l2_swimlane_ring` |
| `aicore_pmu_ring_addrs` (table) | host (`PmuCollector::init`) | AICore `KERNEL_ENTRY` → `set_aicore_pmu_ring` |
| `regs` (per-physical-core register-base table) | host (already required for AICPU MMIO) | AICore `KERNEL_ENTRY` resolves `regs[get_physical_core_id()]` → `set_aicore_pmu_reg_base`; AICore `aicore_execute` caches the value at Phase-3 |

AICore's per-core profiling slots live in
[`aicore/aicore_profiling_state.h`](../src/a5/platform/include/aicore/aicore_profiling_state.h)
— `[[block_local]]` static on onboard, `pthread_key_t` TLS in sim. The
runtime `aicore_execute(runtime, block_idx, core_type)` signature is
unchanged; adding a new profiling field touches `KernelArgs` and this
state surface, never the runtime protocol.

### 8.2 Stable AICore staging ring (decouples AICore write from AICPU buffer rotation)

L2Swimlane and PMU on a5 both use the "AICore writes, AICPU commits" model.
The AICore-side write target is a per-core
[`L2SwimlaneAicoreRing`](../src/a5/platform/include/common/l2_swimlane_profiling.h) /
[`PmuAicoreRing`](../src/a5/platform/include/common/pmu_profiling.h) of
`PLATFORM_{L2,PMU}_AICORE_RING_SIZE` (= 2, dual-issue) slots, allocated
once by the host and addressed by
`BufferState::aicore_ring_ptr` (AICPU-visible) and the per-core
`aicore_*_ring_addrs[block_idx]` (AICore-visible). The address is
never reassigned, so AICore's write target is stable across AICPU's
rotating `L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskBuffer` / `PmuBuffer` flips — flipping is now
fully internal to `*_complete_record` and never crosses into Handshake.

Everything else — Module concept contract, alloc policy
(drain-shard top-up + proactive replenish), `kIdleTimeoutSec` / `kSubsystemName`
contract, mgmt-then-poll start/stop ordering, buffer-pool sizing
constants — matches a2a3 exactly. New collectors should be reviewed
against both arches when added.
