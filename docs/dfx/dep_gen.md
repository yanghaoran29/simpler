# dep_gen — Complete Per-Submit Dependency Graph (Tensor-Annotated)

## 1. Background & Motivation

The swimlane profiler used to expose a per-task `fanout[]` array — the
obvious place to read "which tasks did task X feed into?" — but it was
**structurally incomplete on real hardware**, so it has been removed from
the record entirely. The device hot path no longer carries fanout;
`deps.json` is now the sole source of truth for swimlane edges.

When it existed, each producer task carried its own
`L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord.fanout[]`, populated by the AICPU scheduler at the
moment it wired a downstream consumer. If a producer had already finished and
transitioned to `PTO2_TASK_COMPLETED` by the time a later submit wanted to
register a dependency on it, the consumer's edge had nowhere to go — the
record was sealed, the slot was closed, and the edge was silently dropped.
This was not a bug in fanout itself; fanout is "successors known at runtime",
not "successors discoverable from the orchestrator's input". Race window in
[#599](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/issues/599); see also the
PR #500 archive for the historical attempt to fix this in-place.

`dep_gen` sidesteps the race by capturing the **inputs** to every
`Orchestrator::submit_task` call into a host-resident record stream
(no on-disk hop) and replaying them offline through the same
`compute_task_fanin` / `register_task_outputs` primitives the device
orchestrator uses. The host replay sees every submit — there is no
"already retired" producer because nothing retires during replay. The
output, `deps.json`, was a strict superset of the old fanout edges: every
fanout edge appeared in deps.json, plus the edges fanout dropped due to the
race — which is why deps.json now fully replaces the removed `fanout[]`.

---

## 2. Overview

- **Capture point.** `pto_orchestrator::submit_task` writes a
  `DepGenRecord` (task_id, scope flag, tensor blobs, arg types,
  explicit deps, kernel ids, and SPMD block num) into a per-thread
  shared-memory ring buffer for every call when `enable_dep_gen` is on.
- **In-memory drain.** The host `DepGenCollector` (background mgmt
  thread, ProfilerBase machinery shared with PMU / L2 Perf / Tensor
  Dump) drains the ring into a `std::vector<DepGenRecord>` resident on
  the runner. No `submit_trace.bin` lands on disk — the host already
  has the records once the run ends, and going through the filesystem
  would just be extra I/O.
- **Host replay (dual-pass, self-checking).** After `reconcile_counters()`
  confirms a clean trace (no drops, no leftovers),
  `dep_gen_replay_emit_deps_json` runs every record back through *two*
  parallel host-resident `PTO2TensorMap` instances that evolve in lockstep:
  - **Oracle pass** drives the canonical `compute_task_fanin` template
      from `pto_dep_compute.h` and collects the producer-id set the
      runtime would have emitted.
  - **Annotated pass** runs an inlined mirror of STEP A
      (creator retention) + STEP B (tensormap lookup) against the second
      map, with a wider callback so each edge gets recorded with its
      tensor metadata (producer/consumer shape + offset, dtype, version).
  Per-record semantics mirror runtime `submit_task` exactly: STEP 1
  (explicit deps), STEP 3 (creator retention + tensormap lookup),
  STEP 4 (register outputs). Per-successor dedup matches
  `PTO2FaninBuilder::append_fanin_or_fail`. After both passes finish per
  record, the replay asserts the two producer-id sets are equal; if they
  diverge, `deps.json` is not written and the function returns non-zero.
  This is the guarantee against silent shotgun modifications — anyone
  who changes `compute_task_fanin` semantics will trip the gate
  immediately and know to update the annotated mirror.
- **Output.** `<output_prefix>/deps.json` — strided-Tensor schema with
  `tasks[]`, `tensors[]`, and tensor-annotated `edges[]` (see §4).

## 3. How to Enable

`dep_gen` is gated by `CallConfig.enable_dep_gen` (alongside
`enable_l2_swimlane`, `enable_dump_args`, `enable_pmu`). The CLI flag
is `--enable-dep-gen`:

```bash
# Standalone
python test_my_case.py --platform <a2a3|a5> --enable-dep-gen --enable-l2-swimlane

# Pytest
pytest tests/st/... --platform <a2a3|a5> --enable-dep-gen --enable-l2-swimlane
```

The `--enable-l2-swimlane` flag is independent but recommended in pair
because:

- `deps.json` is the dep_gen artifact.
- `l2_swimlane_records.json` (from swimlane) is the timing artifact;
  `merged_swimlane.json` (the Perfetto trace) uses `deps.json` for
  dependency arrows when both files exist (without it, the trace has no
  dependency arrows — the record no longer carries `fanout[]`).

For perf-sensitive runs where you'd rather measure each profiler in
isolation, see the **split workflow** described in
[l2-swimlane-profiling §3.5](l2-swimlane-profiling.md#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen)
— one dep_gen capture per topology, then any number of swimlane
runs that the converter joins back to that captured graph.

When `--enable-dep-gen` is on with any other diagnostic flag, an
`output_prefix` directory must be set (the runtime throws otherwise).
The standard SceneTest path
(`outputs/<TestName>_<case>_<timestamp>/`) handles that automatically.

## 4. Output: `deps.json`

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"task_id": "0",          "scope": "auto", "kernel_ids": [-1,-1,-1], "block_num": 1, "args": []},

       "start_offset": "0", "strides": [1]}
    ]}
  ],

     "consumer_shape": [16384],
     "consumer_start_offset": "0", "consumer_strides": [1]},
    {"pred": "4294967296", "succ": "4294967298", "arg": 0, "source": "tensormap",

  ]
}
```

All 64-bit unsigned fields (`task_id`, `tensor_id`, `pred`, `succ`,
`buffer_addr`) are serialized as JSON **strings**, not numbers. Many
JavaScript-based JSON parsers can only safely represent integers up to
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 − 1); `tensor_id` (FNV-1a hash) and
`buffer_addr` (hardware address) routinely exceed that limit and would
silently lose precision if encoded as numbers. Python consumers pass
these through `int(v)` which accepts either form, so the schema is
JS-safe without burdening Python.

Task ids encode `(ring_id << 32) | local_id` — the same layout as
`PTO2TaskId::raw`:

```python
ring = (raw >> 32) & 0xFF
local = raw & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

### `tasks[]`

One entry per task observed in the trace. `scope` is `"manual"` when the
submit happened inside a manual scope (no automatic dependency wiring)
and `"auto"` otherwise. `kernel_ids` is the per-subslot
`[aic,aiv0,aiv1]` kernel id triple, with inactive subslots encoded as
`-1`. `block_num` is the SPMD logical block num for the submit; `1`
means a normal single-block task and values greater than `1` identify
SPMD tasks. Tools that only need task-pair edges can ignore this block.

### `tensors[]`

One entry per unique `(buffer_addr, version)` pair touched by the trace.
`tensor_id` is a stable FNV-1a 64-bit hash of that pair — identical
inputs across runs yield the same id, making `deps.json` files diffable.
`buffer_numel` is the element count of the **underlying buffer**, not the
slice; per-edge slice geometry (`shape` + `start_offset` + `strides`)
lives in the `edges[]` entries.

### `edges[]`

Each edge is `{pred, succ}` plus annotation. Fields:

| Field | Type | When present | Meaning |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| `pred`, `succ` | uint64 (string) | always | `PTO2TaskId::raw` of producer and consumer |
| `arg` | int32 | always | Consumer's arg-slot index; `-1` for `explicit` source |
| `source` | string | always | `explicit` (from `explicit_deps[]`), `creator` (`owner_task_id` retention), or `tensormap` (overlap lookup hit) |
| `overlap` | string | `source=tensormap` | `covered` (producer slice fully contains consumer slice) or `other` |
| `tensor_id` | uint64 (string) | not `explicit` | Identity of the underlying tensor; cross-references `tensors[]` |
| `consumer_dtype` | string | not `explicit` | Element type the consumer reads as |
| `consumer_shape` | uint32 array | not `explicit` | Per-dim element count of the consumer slice |
| `consumer_start_offset` | uint64 (string) | not `explicit` | Element offset of the consumer slice into the buffer |
| `consumer_strides` | uint32 array | not `explicit` | Per-dim stride (in elements) of the consumer slice; runtime invariant > 0 |
| `producer_shape` | uint32 array | `source=tensormap` | Per-dim element count of the producer slice |
| `producer_start_offset` | uint64 (string) | `source=tensormap` | Element offset of the producer slice |
| `producer_strides` | uint32 array | `source=tensormap` | Per-dim stride of the producer slice; runtime invariant > 0 |

A single `(pred, succ)` pair can appear in `edges[]` multiple times if
the producer drives the consumer through multiple slots, multiple
sources, or multiple tensormap matches (different slice / version). For
"is task X a successor of task Y at all?" questions, project edges down
to the `(pred, succ)` set; for "what specifically did Y feed into X?",
keep the full annotation.

`deps.json` can have `"edges":[]` when the workload's tasks have no
inter-task data dependencies (e.g. embarrassingly parallel kernels
under scope_end barriers). `tasks[]` and `tensors[]` still list every
observed task and tensor — that is not an error.

## 5. Visualizing — `deps_viewer.py`

`simpler_setup/tools/deps_viewer.py` turns `deps.json` into either a
plain-text dependency view (default) or a self-contained pan/zoom HTML page
(Graphviz SVG with inline vanilla-JS drag/scroll panning and Ctrl+scroll or
pinch zooming). The text view is optimized for grep / diff / "what does task X
depend on?" debugging; the HTML view stays available when you want a visual
layout.

```bash
# Newest deps.json under outputs/ -> deps_viewer.txt
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer

# Specific path -> deps_viewer.txt next to deps.json
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/.../deps.json

# Explicit HTML output
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/.../deps.json --format html

# HTML output with per-task tensor details
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/.../deps.json --format html --show-tensor-info

# Big HTML graphs: use force-directed layout (recommended >1000 nodes)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer deps.json --format html --engine sfdp

```

The default text output contains:

- `SUMMARY` — input path plus task / edge / tensor counts.
  - `tasks`: number of task ids rendered in the output
  - `unique_task_edges`: number of unique `(pred, succ)` task pairs
  - `annotated_edges`: number of annotated edge rows across all task pairs
  - `perf_sidecar`: `yes` when `l2_swimlane_records.json` was successfully loaded
  - `func_name_map`: `yes` when at least one task label resolved to a named `func_name`
    from either an explicit `--func-names` file or an auto-discovered sibling
    `name_map*.json`. When the `kernel_ids` fallback is used, `func_id=` shows an
    aligned 3-slot integer array in `[aic,aiv0,aiv1]` order; inactive slots remain
    `-1`. `func_name_map` stays `no` unless a real human-readable name was resolved.
- `TASK INDEX` — one line per task with `kind=` + `func_id=` and unique
  `fanin=` / `fanout=` counts for quick grep. SPMD tasks additionally carry
  `SPMD block num = N`, where `N` is the captured logical block num.
- `TASK DETAILS` — one block per task with `FANIN` / `FANOUT` peer task references
  (task-adjacency-only, no tensor detail).

In text mode, HTML-only flags such as `--engine` and `--direction` are
rejected rather than silently ignored.

Node visual encoding (legend top-right of the rendered HTML):

| Shape + color | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Blue rounded box | AIC (cube) — kernel ran on the matrix unit |
| Orange ellipse | AIV (vector) — kernel ran on the vector unit |
| Green diamond | mix — single `submit_task` with `MixedKernels` spanning both core types |
| Gray dashed note | alloc — task from `alloc_tensors` (got a task_id, references downstream via `owner_task_id`, but never dispatched a kernel so has no perf record) |
| Red border + right-side `xN` label | SPMD task with `block_num=N` |

Node labels read as `(ring, local)` with a red border and right-side `xN` block num label for SPMD
tasks. The text output (`deps_viewer.txt`) carries the full `kind=` +
`func_id=` labels and adds `SPMD block num = N` only for SPMD tasks; the HTML
view keeps the graph focused on structure and the SPMD marker.
When you need per-task tensor rows (storage / shape / strides / start_offset)
and arg-port edge routing, rerun the HTML export with `--show-tensor-info`.

Browser controls in the HTML viewer:

- **drag** → pan
- **scroll / two-finger swipe** → pan
- **Ctrl+scroll / trackpad pinch** → zoom about cursor
- **`f` key** → fit to view
- **`r` key** → reset to 1:1

The HTML scales to graphs the browser's SVG renderer can handle — in
practice, ~50k nodes with `--engine sfdp`. Past that, you want a
canvas/WebGL viewer (Cytoscape.js, sigma.js), which is out of scope
for this tool. The default text output does not depend on Graphviz and is the
preferred mode for large graphs that need fast generation or grep-first
inspection.

## 6. Relationship to `fanout[]` + Validation Gate

When checking fanout coverage, project annotated edges down to a
`{(pred, succ)}` set first — the per-edge annotation distinguishes
sources / args / slices, so the raw `edges[]` count is a superset of the
underlying task-pair count.

`deps.json` (projected) was a **superset** of the now-removed `fanout[]`
edges — which is exactly why it replaced them as the sole edge source:

| Edge source | Captures | Drops on race? |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `task.fanout[]` (removed; formerly on L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord) | Successors known at producer-retire time | **Yes** — sealed when producer retires |
| `deps.json` (this feature) | Every consumer → producer reachable via tensormap / explicit_deps | No — replay sees every submit |

`tests/st/{a2a3,a5}/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/dfx/dep_gen/test_dep_gen.py`
enforces the 6-edge expectation against the `vector_example`
orchestration as a validation gate: any edge missing from `deps.json`
is a replay-side regression and fails the test. (The record no longer
carries `fanout[]`, so there is no longer a `fanout ⊆ deps` cross-check —
`deps.json` is the only edge source.) The
`swimlane_converter.py` uses `deps.json` (when present) as the source
of flow events in the Perfetto trace, and flags any edge whose
`pred.end_time > succ.start_time` as `hb_violation` (rendered as a
distinct flow event name so Perfetto colors it apart from regular
dependencies). Dependency flows connect the source and destination
bar starts; the completion timestamps are used only for the
`hb_violation` classification, not for flow geometry.

## 7. Big-Fanin Submits: Overflow Chain

A `DepGenRecord` carries up to **64** explicit_deps inline. Submits with
more than 64 explicit deps spill into a chain of `DepGenOverflowRecord`
slots that overlay normal record slots in the buffer.

| Submit `explicit_dep_count` | Chain shape | Per-submit slots used |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| `0 ≤ dc ≤ 64` | base only — fast path, no chain bookkeeping | 1 |
| `65 ≤ dc ≤ 646` | base (64 deps) + 1 overflow (up to 582 deps) | 2 |
| `647 ≤ dc ≤ 1228` | base + 2 overflow | 3 |
| general | base + `⌈(dc − 64) / 582⌉` overflow | `1 + ⌈(dc − 64) / 582⌉` |

**Wire format.** An overflow record reinterprets the same 4672-byte slot
as `{ task_id (8) + flags (4) + dep_count (2) + _reserved (2) + deps[582] }` —
no tensor blobs (those live on the base record). Replay distinguishes
the two views by `flags & DEP_GEN_FLAG_OVERFLOW`. Chain records always
share the base's `task_id`, and the last one sets
`DEP_GEN_FLAG_LAST_OVERFLOW` so replay knows the chain is complete
without peeking ahead.

**Atomicity.** The AICPU writer reserves *all* chain slots up front: if
the current buffer can't hold the full chain, it switches buffer first.
`buf->count` is published with a single store at the end, so the host
either sees the old count (chain invisible) or the new count with the
full chain committed. Chain records are therefore always contiguous
within one buffer — replay scans linearly and ties them back to the
base via `task_id`.

**Truncation tail.** A submit whose chain exceeds the buffer's slot
budget (`PLATFORM_DEP_GEN_RECORDS_PER_BUFFER = 1024` slots → roughly
`64 + 1023 × 582 = 595450` deps max in the best case) is logged via
`LOG_ERROR` and truncated to the largest dc that fits. Runtime
correctness is unaffected — `L0TaskArgs::set_dependencies` keeps the full dep
list; only the dep_gen replay graph loses the tail.

## 8. Architecture Touchpoints

| Layer | File | Role |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Shared-mem layout | `src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/include/common/dep_gen.h` | `DepGenRecord` (4672 B base, cache-line aligned, ≤64 inline explicit_deps, per-task `block_num`) + `DepGenOverflowRecord` chain view (≤582 deps per slot) + SPSC ring + per-thread ready queue. Byte-identical layout across platforms. |
| AICPU writer | `src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/include/aicpu/dep_gen_collector_aicpu.h`, `src/common/platform/shared/aicpu/dep_gen_collector_aicpu.cpp` | Single-instance write path; weak-fallback exported to host build. Both platforms share the same writer implementation — the writer accesses its own device-side view of shared memory, independent of how host↔device transport is implemented. |
| Host collector | `src/common/platform/include/host/dep_gen_collector.h`, `src/common/platform/shared/host/dep_gen_collector.cpp` | `ProfilerBase<DepGenCollector, DepGenModule>` — drains ring → `records_` vector. On non-SVM platforms it uses the base `alloc_paired_buffer`, which malloc's a host shadow + `copy_to_device`'s it and registers it via `add_malloc_shadow` so teardown can free it; `reconcile_counters` explicitly `copy_from_device`'s the BufferState before reading, and `finalize` lets `BufferPoolManager::clear_mappings()` release all shadows as the single source of truth. |
| Capture call site | `src/{a2a3,a5}/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/pto_orchestrator.cpp` `submit_task_common` | One conditional block that snapshots inputs into the ring when `is_dep_gen_enabled()`; fires for both `submit_task` and `submit_dummy_task`. The schema carries `kernel_ids[3] = {aic, aiv0, aiv1}` so the swimlane post-processor can resolve `task_id → kernel` from `deps.json` at level=1 where the AICore record is the sole device-side identity source. Inactive subslots stay at `INVALID_KERNEL_ID = -1`. It also carries the SPMD logical block num (`block_num` on a2a3, `core_num` on a5's launch spec) as `tasks[].block_num`. |
| Replay | `src/{a2a3,a5}/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/host/dep_gen_replay.{h,cpp}` | Pure CPU; runs dual-pass differential replay — `compute_task_fanin` (oracle) + inlined STEP A/B mirror (annotated) against two `PTO2TensorMap` instances. Emits `deps.json` when both passes agree per record. Platform-agnostic — a5 reuses the a2a3 source verbatim. |
| Device-runner hookup | `src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/{onboard,sim}/host/device_runner.cpp` | post-`reconcile_counters` calls `dep_gen_replay_emit_deps_json(records.data(), records.size(), deps_path)` |
| Viewer | `simpler_setup/tools/deps_viewer.py` | `deps.json` → text (default) or pan/zoom HTML |
| Test | `tests/st/{a2a3,a5}/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/dfx/dep_gen/test_dep_gen.py` + `test_dep_gen_chain.py` | Smoke test + 6-edge validation against `vector_example` orchestration (both platforms share byte-identical orchestration code). |

Supported on both a2a3 and a5. The a5 host collector differs from a2a3 only in its host↔device transport path (a5 has no SVM, so all transfers go through `profiling_copy_to_device` / `profiling_copy_from_device` instead of relying on `halHostRegister`'s shared mapping); the AICPU writer, shared-memory ABI, runtime call site, and replay are platform-agnostic.
