# dep_gen — Complete Per-Submit Dependency Graph (Tensor-Annotated)

## 1. Background & Motivation

The swimlane profiler used to expose a per-task `fanout[]` array — the
obvious place to read "which tasks did task X feed into?" — but it was
**structurally incomplete on real hardware**, so it has been removed from
the record entirely. The device hot path no longer carries fanout;
`deps.json` is now the sole source of truth for swimlane edges.

When it existed, each producer task carried its own
`ChipSwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord.fanout[]`, populated by the AICPU scheduler at the
moment it wired a downstream consumer. If a producer had already finished and
transitioned to `CHIP_TASK_COMPLETED` by the time a later submit wanted to
register a dependency on it, the consumer's edge had nowhere to go — the
record was sealed, the slot was closed, and the edge was silently dropped.
This was not a bug in fanout itself; fanout is "successors known at runtime",
not "successors discoverable from the orchestrator's input". Race window in
[#599](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/issues/599); see also the
PR #500 archive for the historical attempt to fix this in-place.

`dep_gen` sidesteps the race by building the graph from the
**orchestrator's** side of the dependency computation rather than the
scheduler's, so a producer that has already retired is still an edge. How
that is done depends on where the orchestrator runs — see §2 for the two
shapes — but the output is the same `deps.json`, and either way it was a
strict superset of the old fanout edges: every fanout edge appeared in
deps.json, plus the edges fanout dropped due to the race — which is why
deps.json now fully replaces the removed `fanout[]`.

---

## 2. Overview

dep_gen has two shapes, chosen by where the orchestrator runs. Both emit the
same `deps.json` (§4), so every consumer — deps viewer, swimlane join — reads
either one the same way, with one documented exception: an edge's `flags`
(WAIT/RETAIN) describes `tensormap_and_ringbuffer`'s own dependency computation,
which `host_build_graph` has no equivalent of, so only the device-orchestrated
shape emits it. A consumer must treat `flags` as optional.

### 2.1 Device orchestration (`tensormap_and_ringbuffer`)

The orchestrator runs on the AICPU, where the host cannot observe it, so the
inputs to each submit are captured and the graph is reconstructed afterwards.

- **Capture point.** `pto_orchestrator::submit_task` writes a
  `DepGenRecord` (task_id, scope flag, tensor blobs, arg types,
  explicit deps, kernel ids, and SPMD block num) into a per-thread
  shared-memory ring buffer for every call when `enable_dep_gen` is on.
- **In-memory drain.** The host `DepGenCollector` (background mgmt
  thread, ProfilerBase machinery shared with PMU / L2 Perf / Tensor
  Dump) drains the ring into a `std::vector<DepGenRecord>` resident on
  the runner. No `submit_trace.bin` lands on disk — the host already
  has the records once the run ends, and going through the filesystem
  would just be extra I/O.
- **Host replay (dual-pass, self-checking).** After `reconcile_counters()`
  confirms a clean trace (no drops, no leftovers),
  `dep_gen_replay_emit_deps_json` runs every record back through *two*
  parallel host-resident `ChipTensorMap` instances that evolve in lockstep:
  - **Oracle pass** drives the canonical `compute_task_fanin` template
      from `dep_compute.h` and collects the producer-id → `DepFlags`
      mapping the runtime would have emitted (flags OR-accumulated per
      producer).
  - **Annotated pass** runs an inlined mirror of STEP A
      (creator retention) + STEP B (tensormap lookup) against the second
      map, with a wider callback so each edge gets recorded with its
      tensor metadata (producer/consumer shape + offset, dtype, version).
  Per-record semantics mirror runtime `submit_task` exactly: STEP 1
  (explicit deps), STEP 3 (creator retention + tensormap lookup),
  STEP 4 (register outputs). Per-successor dedup matches
  `FaninBuilder::append_fanin_or_fail`. After both passes finish per
  record, the replay asserts the two producer-id → `DepFlags` mappings are
  equal (same producers and same per-producer flags); if they diverge,
  `deps.json` is not written and the function returns non-zero.
  This is the guarantee against silent shotgun modifications — anyone
  who changes `compute_task_fanin` semantics will trip the gate
  immediately and know to update the annotated mirror.
  Explicit deps are a common captured input to both passes, so this gate
  cannot independently validate their recorded kind bytes. The a2a3/a5
  dep_gen chain scene tests validate that capture/replay round-trip across
  inline and overflow records.
- **Output.** `<output_prefix>/deps.json` — strided-Tensor schema with
  `tasks[]`, `tensors[]`, and tensor-annotated `edges[]` (see §4).
- **Edges are as-constructed, not as-reduced.** Both passes replay the same
  fanin construction, so `deps.json` records the pre-reduction edge set.
  The `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` runtime's bounded bitmap transitive
  reduction (`reduce_wait_edges`, applied when the builder flushes in
  `submit_task_common`) runs *after* construction and clears the `wait`
  flag on a direct edge already covered by a WAIT path through the
  producer's own transitive ancestors. A diamond `A→B→C` + `A→C` still
  shows `A→C` with its constructed flags. The differential gate is
  unaffected — both passes replay the same construction. What the
  reduction changes is the edge's flags: a redundant `WAIT|RETAIN` edge
  demotes to RETAIN-only and a redundant `WAIT`-only edge drops to
  `DEP_NONE`, with the entry kept either way, so retention and
  pin-release accounting are preserved and only readiness enforcement
  is relaxed.
  [`wait_reduction_sim`](../../simpler_setup/tools/README.md#wait_reduction_sim)
  replays the reduction offline over a capture to measure its coverage
  against the full-DAG upper bound.

### 2.2 Host orchestration (`host_build_graph`)

The orchestrator runs on the host, to completion, before any scheduler thread
starts. Every submit and every tensormap hit is therefore observable in-process
and in order, so the graph is **recorded as the runtime builds it** — there is
nothing to capture-then-reconstruct.

- **Capture point.** `submit_task_common` opens the task's entry, and
  `compute_task_fanin`'s `Annotate` hooks fire on each producer the runtime
  actually wires: creator retention (Step A) and tensormap lookup (Step B), plus
  the declared dependencies at STEP 1. The edges are the runtime's own, not a
  replay's inference, so they cannot drift from `compute_task_fanin` semantics.
- **No ring, no collector, no replay.** The device-side dep_gen writer, its
  shared-memory ring, and the drain thread are all skipped
  (`dep_gen_host_graph_active()` tells the runner). Nothing is dropped under
  back-pressure because nothing is streamed.
- **Output.** The same `deps.json`, written at the end of the run's own `bind` —
  the point where host orchestration completes and the graph is final. The graph
  is thread-local, so it is written on the thread that captured it rather than
  waiting for the drain, which the run lane does not pin to that thread: it
  serializes with a mutex, which gives mutual exclusion but not thread affinity.
  A consequence worth knowing: a run whose device execution later fails still
  leaves its `deps.json`, because its orchestration did happen.

## 3. How to Enable

`dep_gen` is gated by `CallConfig.enable_dep_gen` (alongside
`enable_chip_swimlane`, `enable_dump_args`, `enable_pmu`). The CLI flag
is `--enable-dep-gen`:

```bash
# Standalone
python test_my_case.py --platform <a2a3|a5> --enable-dep-gen --enable-chip-swimlane

# Pytest
pytest tests/st/... --platform <a2a3|a5> --enable-dep-gen --enable-chip-swimlane
```

The `--enable-chip-swimlane` flag is independent but recommended in pair
because:

- `deps.json` is the dep_gen artifact.
- `chip_swimlane_records.json` (from swimlane) is the timing artifact;
  `merged_swimlane.json` (the Perfetto trace) uses `deps.json` for
  dependency arrows when both files exist (without it, the trace has no
  dependency arrows — the record no longer carries `fanout[]`).

For perf-sensitive runs where you'd rather measure each profiler in
isolation, see the **split workflow** described in
[chip-swimlane-profiling §3.5](chip-swimlane-profiling.md#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen)
— one dep_gen capture per topology, then any number of swimlane
runs that the converter joins back to that captured graph.

When `--enable-dep-gen` is on with any other diagnostic flag, an
`output_prefix` directory must be set (the runtime throws otherwise).
The standard SceneTest path
(`outputs/<TestName>_<case>_<timestamp>/`) handles that automatically.

## 4. Output: `deps.json`

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {"task_id": "0",          "scope": "auto", "kernel_ids": [-1,-1,-1], "block_num": 1, "args": []},
    {"task_id": "4294967296", "scope": "auto", "kernel_ids": [7,-1,-1], "block_num": 4, "args": [

    ]}
  ],

     "buffer_addr": "29204938752", "version": 0,
     "dtype": "FLOAT32", "buffer_numel": "16384"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"pred": "0", "succ": "4294967296", "arg": 0, "source": "creator",

     "consumer_shape": [16384],
     "consumer_start_offset": "0", "consumer_strides": [1]},
    {"pred": "4294967296", "succ": "4294967298", "arg": 0, "source": "tensormap",
     "flags": ["wait"],
     "overlap": "covered",

     "producer_shape": [16384],
     "producer_start_offset": "0", "producer_strides": [1]}
  ]
}
```

All 64-bit unsigned fields (`task_id`, `tensor_id`, `pred`, `succ`,
`buffer_addr`) are serialized as JSON **strings**, not numbers. Many
JavaScript-based JSON parsers can only safely represent integers up to
`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 − 1); `tensor_id` (FNV-1a hash) and
`buffer_addr` (hardware address) routinely exceed that limit and would
silently lose precision if encoded as numbers. Python consumers pass
these through `int(v)` which accepts either form, so the schema is
JS-safe without burdening Python.

Task ids are `TaskId::raw`. The low 32 bits are a local id; the high 32 bits
mean whatever the runtime that minted the record says they mean — a ring index
(`tensormap_and_ringbuffer`, `0..CHIP_MAX_RING_DEPTH-1`) or an id space
(`host_build_graph`, `0 = GLOBAL`, `1 = IN_GRAPH`). See
`src/common/{tensormap_and_ringbuffer,host_build_graph}/task_id.h`.
Which one a record carries is a property of its runtime, not of the value:

```python
high = (raw >> 32) & 0xFF
local = raw & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

### `tasks[]`

One entry per task observed in the trace. `scope` is `"manual"` when the
submit happened inside a manual scope (no automatic dependency wiring)
and `"auto"` otherwise. `kernel_ids` is the per-subslot
`[aic,aiv0,aiv1]` kernel id triple, with inactive subslots encoded as
`-1`. `block_num` is the SPMD logical block num for the submit; `1`
means a normal single-block task and values greater than `1` identify
SPMD tasks. Tools that only need task-pair edges can ignore this block.

### `tensors[]`

One entry per unique `(buffer_addr, version)` pair touched by the trace.
`tensor_id` is a stable FNV-1a 64-bit hash of that pair — identical
inputs across runs yield the same id, making `deps.json` files diffable.
`buffer_numel` is the element count of the **underlying buffer**, not the
slice; per-edge slice geometry (`shape` + `start_offset` + `strides`)
lives in the `edges[]` entries.

### `edges[]`

Each edge is `{pred, succ}` plus annotation. Fields:

| Field | Type | When present | Meaning |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------- |
| `pred`, `succ` | uint64 (string) | always | `TaskId::raw` of producer and consumer |
| `arg` | int32 | always | Consumer's arg-slot index; `-1` for `explicit` source |
| `source` | string | always | `explicit` (from `explicit_deps[]`), `creator` (`owner_task_id` retention), or `tensormap` (overlap lookup hit) |
| `flags` | string array | `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` | Subset of `["wait", "retain"]` — the edge's `DepFlags`. `wait` = ordering (readiness); `retain` = producer lifetime held until the consumer releases. `creator` edges are `["wait","retain"]`; `tensormap` edges `["wait"]`. `explicit` edges start with the per-dependency kind captured at submit time, so `CoreTaskArgsWithDeps::add_dep_wait()` emits `["wait"]` while the default dependency kind emits `["wait","retain"]`. When the same producer is also the creator of an input, replay matches runtime fanin dedup by OR-accumulating the creator's flags into the explicit edge. `DepFlags` is a `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` runtime concept — it does not exist in the host_build_graph tree — so the host-orchestrated writer omits the field rather than lagging behind it. Consumers must treat it as optional. |
| `overlap` | string | `source=tensormap` | `covered` (producer slice fully contains consumer slice) or `other` |
| `tensor_id` | uint64 (string) | not `explicit` | Identity of the underlying tensor; cross-references `tensors[]` |
| `consumer_dtype` | string | not `explicit` | Element type the consumer reads as |
| `consumer_shape` | uint32 array | not `explicit` | Per-dim element count of the consumer slice |
| `consumer_start_offset` | uint64 (string) | not `explicit` | Element offset of the consumer slice into the buffer |
| `consumer_strides` | uint32 array | not `explicit` | Per-dim stride (in elements) of the consumer slice; runtime invariant > 0 |
| `producer_shape` | uint32 array | `source=tensormap` | Per-dim element count of the producer slice |
| `producer_start_offset` | uint64 (string) | `source=tensormap` | Element offset of the producer slice |
| `producer_strides` | uint32 array | `source=tensormap` | Per-dim stride of the producer slice; runtime invariant > 0 |

A single `(pred, succ)` pair can appear in `edges[]` multiple times if
the producer drives the consumer through multiple slots, multiple
sources, or multiple tensormap matches (different slice / version). For
"is task X a successor of task Y at all?" questions, project edges down
to the `(pred, succ)` set; for "what specifically did Y feed into X?",
keep the full annotation.

`deps.json` can have `"edges":[]` when the workload's tasks have no
inter-task data dependencies (e.g. embarrassingly parallel kernels
under scope_end barriers). `tasks[]` and `tensors[]` still list every
observed task and tensor — that is not an error.

---

## 5. Visualizing — `deps_viewer.py`

`simpler_setup/tools/deps_viewer.py` turns `deps.json` into either a
plain-text dependency view (default) or a self-contained pan/zoom HTML page
(Graphviz SVG with inline vanilla-JS drag/scroll panning and Ctrl+scroll or
pinch zooming). The text view is optimized for grep / diff / "what does task X
depend on?" debugging; the HTML view stays available when you want a visual
layout.

```bash
# Newest deps.json under outputs/ -> deps_viewer.txt
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer

# Specific path -> deps_viewer.txt next to deps.json
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/.../deps.json

# Explicit HTML output
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/.../deps.json --format html

# HTML output with per-task tensor details
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/.../deps.json --format html --show-tensor-info

# Big HTML graphs: use force-directed layout (recommended >1000 nodes)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer deps.json --format html --engine sfdp

```

The default text output contains:

- `SUMMARY` — input path plus task / edge / tensor counts.
  - `tasks`: number of task ids rendered in the output
  - `unique_task_edges`: number of unique `(pred, succ)` task pairs
  - `annotated_edges`: number of annotated edge rows across all task pairs
  - `perf_sidecar`: `yes` when `chip_swimlane_records.json` was successfully loaded
  - `func_name_map`: `yes` when at least one task label resolved to a named `func_name`
    from either an explicit `--func-names` file or an auto-discovered sibling
    `name_map*.json`. When the `kernel_ids` fallback is used, `func_id=` shows an
    aligned 3-slot integer array in `[aic,aiv0,aiv1]` order; inactive slots remain
    `-1`. `func_name_map` stays `no` unless a real human-readable name was resolved.
- `TASK INDEX` — one line per task with `kind=` + `func_id=` and unique
  `fanin=` / `fanout=` counts for quick grep. SPMD tasks additionally carry
  `SPMD block num = N`, where `N` is the captured logical block num.
- `TASK DETAILS` — one block per task with `FANIN` / `FANOUT` peer task references
  (task-adjacency-only, no tensor detail).

In text mode, HTML-only flags such as `--engine` and `--direction` are
rejected rather than silently ignored.

Node visual encoding (legend top-right of the rendered HTML):

| Shape + color | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Blue rounded box | AIC (cube) — kernel ran on the matrix unit |
| Orange ellipse | AIV (vector) — kernel ran on the vector unit |
| Green diamond | mix — single `submit_task` with `MixedKernels` spanning both core types |
| Gray dashed note | alloc — task from `alloc_tensors` (got a task_id, references downstream via `owner_task_id`, but never dispatched a kernel so has no perf record) |
| Red border + right-side `xN` label | SPMD task with `block_num=N` |

Node labels read as `(ring, local)` with a red border and right-side `xN` block num label for SPMD
tasks. The text output (`deps_viewer.txt`) carries the full `kind=` +
`func_id=` labels and adds `SPMD block num = N` only for SPMD tasks; the HTML
view keeps the graph focused on structure and the SPMD marker.
When you need per-task tensor rows (storage / shape / strides / start_offset)
and arg-port edge routing, rerun the HTML export with `--show-tensor-info`.

Browser controls in the HTML viewer:

- **drag** → pan
- **scroll / two-finger swipe** → pan
- **Ctrl+scroll / trackpad pinch** → zoom about cursor
- **`f` key** → fit to view
- **`r` key** → reset to 1:1

The HTML scales to graphs the browser's SVG renderer can handle — in
practice, ~50k nodes with `--engine sfdp`. Past that, you want a
canvas/WebGL viewer (Cytoscape.js, sigma.js), which is out of scope
for this tool. The default text output does not depend on Graphviz and is the
preferred mode for large graphs that need fast generation or grep-first
inspection.

## 6. Relationship to `fanout[]` + Validation Gate

When checking fanout coverage, project annotated edges down to a
`{(pred, succ)}` set first — the per-edge annotation distinguishes
sources / args / slices, so the raw `edges[]` count is a superset of the
underlying task-pair count.

`deps.json` (projected) was a **superset** of the now-removed `fanout[]`
edges — which is exactly why it replaced them as the sole edge source:

| Edge source | Captures | Drops on race? |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `task.fanout[]` (removed; formerly on ChipSwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord) | Successors known at producer-retire time | **Yes** — sealed when producer retires |
| `deps.json` (this feature) | Every consumer → producer reachable via tensormap / explicit_deps | No — replay sees every submit |

`tests/st/{a2a3,a5}/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/dfx/dep_gen/test_dep_gen.py`
enforces the 6-edge expectation against the `vector_example`
orchestration as a validation gate: any edge missing from `deps.json`
is a replay-side regression and fails the test. (The record no longer
carries `fanout[]`, so there is no longer a `fanout ⊆ deps` cross-check —
`deps.json` is the only edge source.) The
`swimlane_converter.py` uses `deps.json` (when present) as the source
of flow events in the Perfetto trace, and flags any edge whose
`pred.end_time > succ.start_time` as `hb_violation` (rendered as a
distinct flow event name so Perfetto colors it apart from regular
dependencies). Dependency flows connect the source and destination
bar starts; the completion timestamps are used only for the
`hb_violation` classification, not for flow geometry.

---

## 7. Big-Fanin Submits: Overflow Chain

A `DepGenRecord` carries up to **64** explicit_deps inline. Submits with
more than 64 explicit deps spill into a chain of `DepGenOverflowRecord`
slots that overlay normal record slots in the buffer.

| Submit `explicit_dep_count` | Chain shape | Per-submit slots used |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| `0 ≤ dc ≤ 64` | base only — fast path, no chain bookkeeping | 1 |
| `65 ≤ dc ≤ 588` | base (64 deps) + 1 overflow (up to 524 deps) | 2 |
| `589 ≤ dc ≤ 1112` | base + 2 overflow | 3 |
| general | base + `⌈(dc − 64) / 524⌉` overflow | `1 + ⌈(dc − 64) / 524⌉` |

**Wire format.** An overflow record reinterprets the same 4736-byte slot
as `{ task_id (8) + flags (4) + dep_count (2) + _reserved (2) +
deps[524] + kinds[524] }`; `kinds[]` is a byte-for-byte parallel array of
`DepFlags`. There are no tensor blobs (those live on the base record). Replay distinguishes
the two views by `flags & DEP_GEN_FLAG_OVERFLOW`. Chain records always
share the base's `task_id`, and the last one sets
`DEP_GEN_FLAG_LAST_OVERFLOW` so replay knows the chain is complete
without peeking ahead.

**Atomicity.** The AICPU writer reserves *all* chain slots up front: if
the current buffer can't hold the full chain, it switches buffer first.
`buf->count` is published with a single store at the end, so the host
either sees the old count (chain invisible) or the new count with the
full chain committed. Chain records are therefore always contiguous
within one buffer — replay scans linearly and ties them back to the
base via `task_id`.

**Truncation tail.** A submit whose chain exceeds the buffer's slot
budget (`PLATFORM_DEP_GEN_RECORDS_PER_BUFFER = 1024` slots → roughly
`64 + 1023 × 524 = 536116` deps max in the best case) is logged via
`LOG_ERROR` and truncated to the largest dc that fits. Runtime
correctness is unaffected — `CoreTaskArgs::set_dependencies` keeps the full dep
list; only the dep_gen replay graph loses the tail.

## 8. Architecture Touchpoints

| Layer | File | Role |
| ----- | ---- | ---- |
| Shared-mem layout | `src/common/platform/include/common/dep_gen.h` | `DepGenRecord` (4736 B base, cache-line aligned, ≤64 inline explicit deps and parallel kinds, per-task `block_num`) + `DepGenOverflowRecord` chain view (≤524 dep/kind pairs per slot) + SPSC ring + per-thread ready queue. The layout is shared across platforms. |
| AICPU writer | `src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/include/aicpu/dep_gen_collector_aicpu.h`, `src/common/platform/shared/aicpu/dep_gen_collector_aicpu.cpp` | Single-instance write path; weak-fallback exported to host build. Both platforms share the same writer implementation — the writer accesses its own device-side view of shared memory, independent of how host↔device transport is implemented. |
| Host collector | `src/common/platform/include/host/dep_gen_collector.h`, `src/common/platform/shared/host/dep_gen_collector.cpp` | `ProfilerBase<DepGenCollector, DepGenModule>` — drains ring → `records_` vector. On non-SVM platforms it uses the base `alloc_paired_buffer`, which malloc's a host shadow + `copy_to_device`'s it and registers it via `add_malloc_shadow` so teardown can free it; `reconcile_counters` explicitly `copy_from_device`'s the BufferState before reading, and `finalize` lets `BufferPoolManager::clear_mappings()` release all shadows as the single source of truth. |
| Capture call site (device-orch) | `src/{a2a3,a5}/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/orchestrator.cpp` `submit_task_common` | One conditional block that snapshots inputs into the ring when `is_dep_gen_enabled()`; fires for both `submit_task` and `submit_dummy_task`. The schema carries `kernel_ids[3] = {aic, aiv0, aiv1}` so the swimlane post-processor can resolve `task_id → kernel` from `deps.json` at level=1 where the AICore record is the sole device-side identity source. Inactive subslots stay at `INVALID_KERNEL_ID = -1`. It also carries the SPMD logical block num (`block_num` on a2a3, `core_num` on a5's launch spec) as `tasks[].block_num`. |
| Replay | `src/{a2a3,a5}/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/host/dep_gen_replay.{h,cpp}` | Pure CPU; runs dual-pass differential replay — `compute_task_fanin` (oracle) + inlined STEP A/B mirror (annotated) against two `ChipTensorMap` instances. Emits `deps.json` when both passes agree per record. Platform-agnostic — a5 reuses the a2a3 source verbatim. |
| Host-direct capture (host-orch) | `src/common/host_build_graph/dep_gen_host_graph.h`, `src/common/host_build_graph/host/dep_gen_host_graph.cpp` | Task / tensor / edge tables filled from `submit_task_common` + `compute_task_fanin`'s `Annotate` hooks (`src/common/host_build_graph/dep_compute.h`), reset per orchestration by `run_host_orchestration`, serialized by the same `deps.json` writer. The runtime translation unit carries weak no-op fallbacks so the AICPU build links without it. |
| Device-runner hookup | `src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/{onboard,sim}/host/device_runner.cpp` | `dep_gen_host_graph_active()` picks the shape: host-orch calls `dep_gen_host_graph_emit(deps_path)` at teardown — reading the thread-local graph its own orchestration built on the same child progress thread — and skips collector init/start/reconcile entirely; device-orch calls `dep_gen_replay_emit_deps_json(records.data(), records.size(), deps_path)` post-`reconcile_counters`. The c_api latches the CallConfig before the bind so host capture is armed before the orchestration it records. |
| Viewer | `simpler_setup/tools/deps_viewer.py` | `deps.json` → text (default) or pan/zoom HTML |
| Test | `tests/st/{a2a3,a5}/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/dfx/dep_gen/test_dep_gen.py` + `test_dep_gen_chain.py`, `tests/st/{a2a3,a5}/host_build_graph/dfx/dep_gen/test_dep_gen.py` | Smoke test + edge validation against a `vector_example`-shaped orchestration. Each `host_build_graph` case runs an orchestration through host-direct capture and asserts its declared edges, so a divergence between the two shapes fails a test. The orchestrations are not shared across the two cases — a2a3's dep_gen test carries its own 5-task / 6-edge copy, a5's reuses the 4-task / 4-edge `vector_example` scene test's — so each asserts its own graph. |

The device-orch shape is supported on both a2a3 and a5. The a5 host collector differs from a2a3 only in its host↔device transport path (a5 has no SVM, so all transfers go through `profiling_copy_to_device` / `profiling_copy_from_device` instead of relying on `halHostRegister`'s shared mapping); the AICPU writer, shared-memory ABI, runtime call site, and replay are platform-agnostic.

The host-direct shape is supported on both a2a3 and a5, and is what `host_build_graph`
uses on either. Both architectures reach it through the same
`src/common/host_build_graph/` sources — neither `src/a2a3/runtime/host_build_graph/`
nor `src/a5/runtime/host_build_graph/` carries a dep_gen implementation of its own.
