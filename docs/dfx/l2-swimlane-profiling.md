# L2 Swimlane Profiling — Per-task Timing & Scheduler Phases

## 1. Background & Motivation

Why a kernel takes the time it takes is rarely visible from
end-to-end runtime numbers. Two cases dominate the profiler diet:

- **Task-level timing.** When kernel A is slow, is the kernel slow,
  or is something else holding it up? Where does each AICore task
  start and end on the wall clock, and what fanout / fan-in chain
  does it sit in?
- **Scheduler overhead.** Inside AICPU's scheduling loop, time is
  split across "process completed tasks", "dispatch ready tasks",
  "incremental scan for roots", and "idle wait". When the AICPU
  thread is hot, knowing which of those four phases dominates
  pinpoints the fix.

L2 swimlane profiling captures both: per-task `(start, end,
dispatch, finish)` records on the AICore side, plus per-iteration
phase records on the AICPU scheduler side and a one-shot
orchestrator summary. The host writes a Chrome Trace Event JSON
that loads directly in Perfetto, and the same file feeds a
scheduler-overhead deep-dive report when a device log is
available.

## 2. Overview

- **Per-task AICore timing** — `start_time_us`, `end_time_us`,
  `duration_us`, plus AICPU-stamped `dispatch_time_us` / `finish_time_us`.
- **Per-task dependency arrows** — successor edges are NOT recorded
  in the swimlane record itself (the device hot path stays clean —
  see PR #863). Instead, `swimlane_converter` joins
  `l2_swimlane_records.json` with `deps.json` from
  [`dep_gen`](dep_gen.md) at post-process time; see
  [§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen).
- **AICPU scheduler phases** — per-iteration breakdown into six
  mutually time-exclusive **outer** phases (`complete` / `dispatch`
  / `release` / `wire` / `dummy` / `early_dispatch`), one **inner**
  phase that nests inside its parent outer (`resolve`, parent =
  Complete or Dummy), and one **separate-lane** phase
  (`dummy_task`, rendered on Worker View AICPU_N rather than on the
  sched lane). Idle iterations no longer emit a record on a2a3; the
  host tooling reconstructs idle spans from the gap between
  consecutive work records on the same thread. See §3.2 for the
  full per-phase table. Legacy captures may carry `scan` / `poll` /
  `idle` / `fanout` / `prestage` — current a2a3 builds no longer
  emit them (PR #1079's Scan/Poll debug overlay was removed;
  Fanout was renamed Resolve and now also filters out <1 µs walks;
  Prestage was renamed EarlyDispatch).
- **Orchestrator submit envelope** — one record per `submit_task()`
  / `alloc_tensors()` call covering the whole submit's
  `[start, end]` window (`orch_submit` phase). Per-sub-step
  cumulative cycles (sync / alloc / params / lookup / insert /
  fanin) still live in the cold-path device log via the
  `g_orch_*_cycle` counters — that's where you go for "which
  sub-step dominates overall"; the per-submit record covers
  "which submit was slow".
- **Standard outputs** — raw `l2_swimlane_records.json`, plus a
  Perfetto-loadable `merged_swimlane_*.json` produced by
  `swimlane_converter`.

Enable in one line:

```bash
python tests/st/<case>/test_<name>.py -p <platform> -d 0 --enable-l2-swimlane
```

## 3. How to Use

### 3.1 Enable L2 swimlane

`--enable-l2-swimlane` accepts an optional integer **perf_level**
(0–4). A bare flag defaults to level 4 (full collection,
backward-compatible with the old boolean behavior).

| Level | Collects | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | ----- |
| 0 | Nothing (disabled) | Default when flag is absent |
| 1 | AICore timing only (start_time_us/end_time_us/task_id/func_id/core_type) | No AICPU timestamps |
| 2 | + dispatch_time_us, finish_time_us | Full per-task AICPU record |
| 3 | + scheduler phases (`aicpu_scheduler_phases[]`) | Skips orchestrator phases |
| 4 | + orchestrator phases (`aicpu_orchestrator_phases[]`) | Full collection |

Dependency arrows are not produced by any swimlane level — see
[§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen) for the dep_gen join.

```bash
# Standalone runner
python tests/st/<case>/test_<name>.py -p <platform> -d 0 --enable-l2-swimlane [PERF_LEVEL]

# pytest — same flag shape
pytest tests/st/<case> --platform <platform> -d 0 --enable-l2-swimlane [PERF_LEVEL]

# Bare flag (no integer) — shorthand for level 4 (full collection)
python tests/st/<case>/test_<name>.py -p <platform> -d 0 --enable-l2-swimlane
```

- `<platform>` — one of `a2a3` / `a2a3sim` / `a5` / `a5sim`; the
  integer perf_level interface is identical across them.
- `[PERF_LEVEL]` — optional integer 0–4 (see table above). Omit the
  argument entirely (bare `--enable-l2-swimlane`) for the level-4
  shorthand; omit the flag entirely for level 0 (disabled).

The flag sets `CallConfig::enable_l2_swimlane` to the chosen
level. The host then allocates the per-core / per-thread shared
region and publishes its base address through
`kernel_args.l2_swimlane_data_base`. AICore writes timing into
per-task WIP slots; AICPU commits the records on FIN. Per-task
dispatch/finish timestamps are recorded only at level >= 2,
scheduler phase records only at level >= 3, and orchestrator phase
records only at level >= 4.

The JSON output `"l2_swimlane_level"` field is the captured perf_level:
`1` = AICore timing only, `2` = +AICPU dispatch/finish,
`3` = +scheduler phases, `4` = +orchestrator phases.

`--rounds > 1` collects only on the **first** round so warm-up
runs are not double-counted.

### 3.2 Output

The raw artifact lands under the per-task output prefix
(`CallConfig::output_prefix`, set by
`scene_test.py::_build_output_prefix` to
`outputs/<ClassName>_<case>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/` for SceneTest
runs):

```text
<output_prefix>/
├── l2_swimlane_records.json     # raw runtime output
├── name_map_<case>.json     # optional func_id → name mapping
└── merged_swimlane.json     # Perfetto trace (added by converter)
```

Filenames are fixed (no per-file timestamp) — the directory is the
per-task uniqueness boundary.

`l2_swimlane_records.json` carries the raw records. **There are two
layers to be aware of:**

- **On-disk (raw, cycle domain).** What the host writes. Compact —
  per-stream tuples plus a small metadata block. Anyone reading the
  file directly with `json.load` sees this shape and only this shape.
- **Reader output (joined, µs domain).**
  `swimlane_converter.read_perf_data()` joins the on-disk streams, fills
  in `core_type` / `core_to_thread`, converts cycles to microseconds
  using `metadata.clock_freq_hz`, and returns the joined dict that every
  downstream consumer (Perfetto converter, `sched_overhead_analysis`,
  `deps_viewer`, in-test validator) reads. Always go through
  `read_perf_data`; never load `l2_swimlane_records.json` with raw
  `json.load` from new code.

#### On-disk schema

```jsonc
{
  "l2_swimlane_level": <1..4>,

  // Everything the python reader needs that isn't a per-record stream.
  "metadata": {
    "clock_freq_hz": <int>,            // cycle→µs factor. a2a3=50e6, a5=1e9.
    "num_cores": <int>,                // == len(core_types)
    "core_types": ["aic"|"aiv", ...],  // indexed by core_id
    "core_to_thread": [<int>, ...]     // optional; level >= 3 only
  },

  // Bulk task streams — flat array of tuples. Column order is fixed.
  //   aicore_tasks: [core_id, task_token_raw, reg_task_id,
  //                  start_cycles, end_cycles]
  //   aicpu_tasks:  [core_id, reg_task_id,
  //                  dispatch_cycles, finish_cycles]
  "aicore_tasks": [[...], ...],
  "aicpu_tasks":  [[...], ...],

  // Per-scheduler-thread arrays of objects (level >= 3 only).
  //   sched record: {kind, start_cycles, end_cycles, loop_iter,
  //                  tasks_processed, [pop_hit, pop_miss]}
  //   orch record:  {submit_idx, task_id, start_cycles, end_cycles}
  // pop_hit / pop_miss are present only on Dispatch records.
  "aicpu_scheduler_phases":    [ [ {...}, ... ], ... ],
  "aicpu_orchestrator_phases": [ [ {...}, ... ], ... ]   // level >= 4 only
}
```

All timestamps on disk are raw `get_sys_cnt` cycles (uint64). The
join key between `aicore_tasks` and `aicpu_tasks` is
`(core_id, reg_task_id)` — *not* `task_token_raw`, because SPMD
`block_num > num_cores` and MIX cluster spread can dispatch the same
`task_token_raw` to the same core multiple times. AICore is the
canonical producer of `task_token_raw`; AICPU only stamps the
dispatch / finish timestamps and the per-core join token.

#### Reader output (µs domain)

After `read_perf_data()` joins the streams and converts to
microseconds, downstream code sees:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `task_id` | Runtime task id (`(ring_id << 32) \| local_id`); also exposed split as`ring_id` |
| `func_id` | Kernel function id. Always `-1` on disk; resolved post-process from `deps.json::tasks[].kernel_ids[3]` (see `swimlane_converter.resolve_func_id_from_kernel_map`) |
| `core_id` / `core_type` | Physical core index and `"aic"` / `"aiv"` string |
| `start_time_us` / `end_time_us` / `duration_us` | AICore execution window in microseconds |
| `dispatch_time_us` | AICPU timestamp when this task was dispatched (filled at level >= 2; `0.0` at level 1) |
| `finish_time_us` | AICPU timestamp when AICPU observed FIN (filled at level >= 2; `0.0` at level 1) |

Note: per-task records carry **no** fanout edges. Dependency arrows
come from a separate `deps.json` (dep_gen) joined at convert time —
see [§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen).

Phase records (per scheduler thread, level >= 3 for
`aicpu_scheduler_phases[]` and level >= 4 for
`aicpu_orchestrator_phases[]`):

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `start_time_us` / `end_time_us` | Phase start / end timestamps in microseconds (reader-side cycle→µs conversion) |
| `phase` | Lowercase phase name. Scheduler: see the table below. Orchestrator: `orch_submit` — one record per `submit_task()` / `alloc_tensors()` call spanning its full `[start, end]` window. Legacy per-sub-step strings (`orch_sync` / `orch_alloc` / `orch_params` / `orch_lookup` / `orch_insert` / `orch_fanin`) may appear in old captures. |
| `loop_iter` (scheduler) / `submit_idx` (orchestrator) | Iteration / submit-call counter for the producing thread |
| `tasks_processed` (scheduler) / `task_id` (orchestrator) | Phase-specific union field (see per-phase table) |
| `pop_hit` / `pop_miss` (dispatch only) | Ready-queue pop deltas since the previous dispatch emit |

Scheduler phase taxonomy — three role classes share one `phase`
field but render differently in Perfetto:

| Phase | Role | Lane | `tasks_processed` semantic |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | -------------------------- |
| `complete` | outer | sched (pid=2) | FIN'd subtasks + sub-block retires this iter |
| `dispatch` | outer | sched | subtasks published this iter |
| `release` | outer | sched | deferred-release slots drained this iter |
| `wire` | outer | sched | tasks wired by `drain_wiring_queue` this iter |
| `dummy` | outer | sched | dummies handled by `dummy_drain` this iter |
| `early_dispatch` | outer | sched | blocks staged by speculative early-dispatch this pass |
| `resolve` | inner | sched (nests in `complete` or `dummy`) | consumers visited in `on_task_complete` |
| `dummy_task` | separate-lane | Worker View AICPU_N (pid=4) | dummy `task_id` low 32 bits (deps.json flow target) |

Outer phases are mutually time-exclusive within an iter — each
emit advances the per-thread phase anchor (`_t0_phase`). Inner
phases (`resolve`) don't advance the anchor; Perfetto nests them
under the parent outer bar via time containment. Separate-lane
phases are routed to a different lane by the converter (Worker
View AICPU_N), so they never overlap visually with the sched
lane bars even when their timestamps fall inside an outer span.

Legacy phases (`scan` / `poll` / `idle` / `fanout` / `prestage`)
are still parsed for old captures but current a2a3/a5 builds no
longer emit them. Renames: `fanout` → `resolve`, `prestage` →
`early_dispatch`. Removed: Scan/Poll (PR #1079 debug overlay).

On disk the sched records carry a `kind` field (string-encoded
phase name); the reader renames it to `phase` so downstream code
can keep a single discriminator name.

`core_to_thread[]` (level >= 3) maps `core_id` (array index) to the
scheduler thread index that retired that core's tasks (`-1` =
unassigned). On disk it lives under `metadata.core_to_thread`; the
reader hoists it to the top of the output dict.

### 3.3 Convert and view in Perfetto

`swimlane_converter` turns the raw records into a Perfetto trace
and produces a per-function task-execution summary:

```bash
# Auto-detects the latest outputs/*/l2_swimlane_records.json
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter

# Pin to a specific case + add func_id → name mapping
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter \
    outputs/<case>_<ts>/l2_swimlane_records.json \
    --func-names outputs/<case>_<ts>/name_map_<case>.json

# Custom output path
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter \
    outputs/<case>_<ts>/l2_swimlane_records.json -o my_trace.json
```

The output is `outputs/<case>_<ts>/merged_swimlane.json` (or your
`-o` override). Open <https://ui.perfetto.dev/> and drag the file
in. The trace contains:

- **Orchestrator** (pid=1) — per-submit `orch_submit` envelope
  blocks (level >= 4).
- **AICPU Scheduler** (pid=2) — per-iteration scheduler phase
  blocks coloured by `phase` (level >= 3). The six outer phases
  (`complete` / `dispatch` / `release` / `wire` / `dummy` /
  `early_dispatch`) appear as sibling bars on each scheduler
  thread's lane; the `resolve` inner phase nests inside its
  parent (`complete` or `dummy`).
- **Scheduler View** (pid=3) — task-execution overlay using AICPU
  dispatch/finish timestamps (level >= 2), with the same labels
  as Worker View.
- **Worker View** (pid=4) — one swim-lane per physical worker:
  - `AIC_N` — matrix cores (kernel exec from level >= 1)
  - `AIV_N` — vector cores (kernel exec from level >= 1)
  - `AICPU_N` — AICPU acting as worker; carries `dummy_task`
    zero-width markers (one per dummy drained by the sched
    thread on AICPU N) and `alloc` bars (from `alloc_tensors()`
    calls that the orchestrator on AICPU 0 inline-completed).
    Both are activities the AICPU performs as a worker, so they
    share the same lane tier as AIC/AIV.

**Task labeling (AICore View and AICPU View) depends entirely on
whether a `deps.json` is present** (see
[§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen)):

- **With `deps.json`** — each task shows `func_name(rXtY)` (or
  `func_<id>(rXtY)` when no name map), and dependency arrows are
  drawn in the AICore View.
- **Without `deps.json`** — the host never records `func_id` (it's
  `-1` on disk), so the converter cannot tell tasks apart by
  function. Every task in **both** views is labeled `task(rXtY)` —
  distinguished only by id — and no arrows are drawn (the converter
  prints a one-line hint). Re-run with `--enable-dep-gen` (or join an
  existing `deps.json`) to recover names and arrows.

When the run also emitted a device log (`device-*` file under
`outputs/`), `swimlane_converter` resolves the nearest log by
mtime and runs `sched_overhead_analysis` automatically. The
report is printed to stdout; it correlates AICPU phase records
with the device log to attribute each scheduler iteration to a
specific overhead source.

### 3.4 Adding human-readable names

Lane labels degrade in two steps:

| What's available | Label | Distinguishable? |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---------------- |
| No `deps.json` (no `--enable-dep-gen`) | `task(rXtY)` | By id only — `func_id` is unresolved |
| `deps.json`, no name map | `func_<id>(rXtY)` | By function id |
| `deps.json` + name map | `QK(rXtY)` | By human name |

So a readable trace needs **both** a `deps.json` (to resolve
`func_id`; see [§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen)) **and** a
name map. To get readable lane labels, add a `name` field to your
CALLABLE spec:

```python
@scene_test(level=2, runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
class TestPagedAttention(SceneTestCase):
    CALLABLE = {
        "orchestration": {
            "source": "kernels/orchestration/orch.cpp",
            "function_name": "build_paged_attention_graph",
            "name": "PagedAttn",                          # optional
            "signature": [D.IN, D.IN, D.IN, D.OUT],
        },
        "incores": [
            {"func_id": 0, "name": "QK", "source": "...", "core_type": "aic"},
            {"func_id": 1, "name": "SF", "source": "...", "core_type": "aiv"},
            {"func_id": 2, "name": "PV", "source": "...", "core_type": "aic"},
        ],
    }
```

SceneTest extracts this into `<output_prefix>/name_map_<case>.json`
and passes it to `swimlane_converter` automatically. See
[profiling-name-map.md](../profiling-name-map.md) for the full
schema and L3 example.

### 3.5 Dependency arrows from dep_gen

Swimlane records carry **timing only**; they do not embed per-task
fanout. The device hot path deliberately omits it (see the
`L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord` comment and PR #863 — a per-task ~1 KB
GM store + a linked-list walk on the scheduler's critical fanin tail
was the price). Dependency arrows in the Perfetto view come from
`deps.json`, the dep_gen artifact, joined at post-process time by
`swimlane_converter`.

Two artifacts, one join:

| File | Producer | What it carries |
| ---- | -------- | --------------- |
| `deps.json` | `--enable-dep-gen` (a [`dep_gen`](dep_gen.md) run) | The static task graph for one topology / case |
| `l2_swimlane_records.json` | `--enable-l2-swimlane` | Per-task / per-phase timing for one run |
| `merged_swimlane.json` | `swimlane_converter` | Perfetto trace = timing joined to the graph |

**Default workflow (paired flags, recommended for most runs):**

```bash
python test_my_case.py --platform a2a3 \
  --enable-dep-gen --enable-l2-swimlane
```

Both artifacts land under the same `<output_prefix>/`; the
converter auto-detects `deps.json` and emits flow arrows. This is the
right default for CI smoke, single debugging runs, and small/medium
workloads.

**Split workflow (two launches, recommended for strict perf
measurement):**

```bash
# Once per topology — produces deps.json.
python test_my_case.py --platform a2a3 --enable-dep-gen

# Any number of perf-measurement runs against the same topology —
# each produces its own l2_swimlane_records.json, all joined to the
# captured graph.
python test_my_case.py --platform a2a3 --enable-l2-swimlane 4
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter \
    outputs/<case_ts>/l2_swimlane_records.json \
    --deps-json outputs/<case_dep_ts>/deps.json
```

Use this when:

- You're measuring overhead at the µs level and want each profiler in
  isolation (combined per-round overhead is still well under 10 µs on
  measured workloads, but if you need certainty, split).
- The same topology is being measured under several configurations
  (one `dep_gen` capture amortizes across N swimlane runs).
- A workload is so large that the dep_gen replay validation gate
  would dominate the swimlane run time.

**Low-distortion workflow (minimal capture, names recovered
offline):** When you want the least possible perturbation — skip the
`dep_gen` replay overhead on the measured run, and/or use a low
swimlane perf_level (e.g. level 1, AICore timing only) — run the perf
capture *without* `--enable-dep-gen`. The resulting trace labels every
task `task(rXtY)` (no `func_id`, no arrows). To recover names and
arrows afterward, take a `deps.json` from a separate `dep_gen` capture
of the same topology, drop it next to your `l2_swimlane_records.json`
(or point `--deps-json` at it), and re-run the converter:

```bash
# Low-overhead perf run — no dep_gen, low level.
python test_my_case.py --platform a2a3 --enable-l2-swimlane 1

# Separately (once per topology), capture the graph.
python test_my_case.py --platform a2a3 --enable-dep-gen

# Join offline: copy the deps.json in, then re-run the converter.
cp outputs/<case_dep_ts>/deps.json outputs/<case_perf_ts>/deps.json
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter \
    outputs/<case_perf_ts>/l2_swimlane_records.json \
    --func-names outputs/<case_perf_ts>/name_map_<case>.json
```

The converter is a pure post-processor — re-running it against the
same raw records with a `deps.json` now present upgrades the labels
from `task(rXtY)` to real names and adds the dependency arrows,
without re-running the workload.

When `--deps-json` is omitted **and** the converter cannot find a
sibling `deps.json` next to `l2_swimlane_records.json`, the trace is
emitted without flow events (correct, just no arrows) and the
converter prints:

```text
Flow events: 0 (no deps.json — re-run dep_gen and pass --deps-json to add arrows)
```

That's the rerun breadcrumb — keep an eye on it, it's the signal
that something dropped on the way from dep_gen to converter.

**SPMD dependency arrows.** For logical tasks with `block_num > 1`,
dependency / `hb_violation` flows connect via **anchor pairing** on
physical core lanes — there is no dedicated `SPMD (block-level)` track.

SPMD tasks use the minimum-`core_id` subtask row per `core_type` as the
dependency anchor; MIX-type SPMD tasks pick the minimum separately for
AIC and AIV.

Non-SPMD tasks (including MIX multi-slot kernels with `block_num == 1`)
keep every subtask row as an endpoint (N×N pairing unchanged).

For each logical `(pred, succ)` edge from `deps.json`, the converter
emits flows between the Cartesian product of pred/succ anchor rows
(`|pred_anchors| × |succ_anchors|`), not a per-subtask crossbar.

**SPMD lane labels.** Logical SPMD tasks append `_spmd` before the
`(rXtY)` suffix unless the function name already contains `spmd`
(case-insensitive), e.g. `v_proj_spmd(r2t10)` vs `SPMD_WRITE_AIV(t0)`.

Flow events carry `input_task_count` / `output_task_count` (SPMD
`block_num`) to annotate fan degree. These arrows visualize **block-level**
`deps.json` edges on representative subtasks — they do **not** imply
runtime per-instance dependency resolution.

**What you do NOT need to script:**

- Pairing input shape / RNG seed across the two launches — `deps.json`
  is graph-shaped, not instance-shaped; two runs of the same case
  with the same `CASES[...]` entry share the same graph by
  construction.
- Running dep_gen ahead of every swimlane run — the graph is stable
  per topology; one capture is enough until the test class changes.

## 4. Capabilities

What the swimlane shows:

- **Per-task wall-clock placement.** Where each task ran on which
  AICore, with `start_time_us` / `end_time_us` / `duration_us` in
  microseconds (converted from device cycles).
- **Dispatch and finish overhead.** `dispatch_time_us` and
  `finish_time_us` come from AICPU, so the gap between
  `dispatch_time_us` and `start_time_us` is the AICPU→AICore
  hand-off latency, and the gap between `end_time_us` and
  `finish_time_us` is the FIN-observation latency.
- **Dependency chains.** When `deps.json` from a paired or prior
  `dep_gen` run is available, `swimlane_converter` emits flow events
  so Perfetto draws arrows between predecessor and successor tasks
  — see [§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen). Without
  `deps.json` the trace is correct but unarrowed. For SPMD tasks,
  dependency arrows use the minimum-`core_id` subtask row per
  `core_type` as the anchor; MIX-type SPMD tasks pick the
  minimum-`core_id` subtask separately for AIC and AIV.
- **Scheduler-loop time decomposition.** Per-iteration AICPU
  phase records show how long the scheduler spent in each of
  its two work phases (complete / dispatch); idle is recovered
  from the gap between records.
- **Orchestrator overhead breakdown.** Per-submit envelope
  records (`orch_submit`) pin "which submit is slow"; cumulative
  cycle counts in the cold-path device log (`g_orch_*_cycle`)
  cover the per-sub-step breakdown for "which sub-step dominates".

## 5. Design Highlights

### 5.1 Common interfaces

`kernel_args.l2_swimlane_data_base` is the single device-side handle
host publishes for the run. The shared region carries a fixed
`L2SwimlaneDataHeader` plus per-core / per-thread state (same struct
shape on both architectures):

```text

 in #941. Host gates on num_{sched,orch}_phase_threads > 0.)
```

Task records are identical across architectures:

- `L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord` — per-task AICPU-owned fields (task_id, dispatch_time,
  finish_time, func_id, core_type, reg_task_id), 64-byte aligned.
  `reg_task_id` is the join key against the matching AICore record.
- `L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskRecord` — slim AICore-only record (start, end, task_id),
  32 bytes; AICore writes one per task into its currently-active
  per-core buffer.

Phase records diverge — a2a3 split them into two type-tagged streams
in #942, a5 still uses the legacy unified shape:

- a2a3:
  - `L2SwimlaneAicpuSchedPhaseRecord` (40 B) — per-iteration scheduler
    phase; kind ∈ {Complete, Dispatch} + loop_iter + tasks_processed +
    pop_hit / pop_miss deltas.
  - `L2SwimlaneAicpuOrchPhaseRecord` (32 B) — per-submit orchestrator
    envelope; task_id + submit_idx + start/end.
- a5:
  - `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseRecord` (40 B) — single record type carrying
    both sched and orch via a `phase_id` discriminator; pending port to
    the split shape.

`swimlane_converter` shape-detects per source and produces the same
output JSON for both. On a2a3 the orch stream replaces the per-sub-step
records folded into ORCH_SUBMIT; there is no separate shared-memory
aggregate. The run-window envelope is emitted to device log via
`LOG_INFO_V9 "orch_start=… orch_end=… orch_cost=…"`.

**Producer/consumer protocol on AICore (AICore-as-producer with rotation).**
AICore writes a slim `L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskRecord` into its currently-active per-core
`L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskBuffer` at `records[slot_within_buf++]`. The active buffer is
published via a per-core `L2SwimlaneActiveHead` cache line (`current_buf_ptr` +
`current_buf_seq` + counters); AICore `dcci`'s it per task — cheap relative
to the baseline `dcci(payload, ENTIRE_DATA_CACHE)` it already pays per
task. AICPU drives rotation: immediately before each `write_reg(DATA_MAIN_BASE)`
for task `K`, if `K % PLATFORM_AICORE_BUFFER_SIZE == 0`, AICPU enqueues
the current buffer to the per-thread ready queue (kind `AicoreTask`),
pops the next from `L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskPool::free_queue`, and bumps
`L2SwimlaneActiveHead::current_buf_seq`. AICore detects the bumped seq on
its next task's `dcci`, refreshes its local cache, and resets its slot
counter to 0.

**Race safety.** The runtime's completion-before-dispatch invariant
guarantees all tasks `< K` have FIN'd before AICPU dispatches `K`, so
by the time AICPU enqueues the old buffer, AICore has finished writing
(and `dcci+dsb`'d) records for all those tasks. No spin-wait, no
cross-direction read on the hot path.

**Sizing.** `PLATFORM_AICORE_BUFFER_SIZE = 1024` (power of two, modulo
lowers to AND) and `PLATFORM_AICORE_BUFFERS_PER_CORE = 4` (1 active +
3 recycled). Host-side `BufferPoolManager` refills the recycled pool
from the ready queue while the session runs, so session length is
bounded only by how fast the host drains — not by the per-core buffer
sum.

**Measured impact.** Hardware bench on a2a3 paged_attention_unroll
Case1 with swimlane=4: rotation design delivers sched -4 µs / orch -19 µs
vs the upstream/main baseline, comparable to the no-rotation predecessor
(which had this PR's earlier commit; the rotation adds about 3 µs
sched overhead per session as price for unbounded session length).

### 5.2 a2a3 — shared-memory streaming

`halHostRegister` maps device memory into host virtual address
space so the host can read device buffers directly.
`L2SwimlaneCollector` runs split mgmt threads and collector shards on top of a
[`BufferPoolManager<L2SwimlaneModule>`](../src/common/platform/include/host/buffer_pool_manager.h):
drain/refill shards poll SPSC ready queues and recycle full buffers
**while kernels are still executing**, a replenish thread keeps free
queues topped up, and collector shards drain the host hand-off queues into
`on_buffer_collected`.

`L2SwimlaneModule` declares four buffer kinds going through one ready
queue per AICPU thread:

- **kind 0** `AicpuTask`        — per-core `L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskBuffer` (AICPU writes).
- **kind 1** `AicpuSchedPhase`  — per-thread `L2SwimlaneAicpuSchedPhaseBuffer` (AICPU writes).
- **kind 2** `AicpuOrchPhase`   — per-thread `L2SwimlaneAicpuOrchPhaseBuffer` (AICPU writes).
- **kind 3** `AicoreTask`       — per-core `L2SwimlaneAicoreTaskBuffer` (AICore writes,
  AICPU enqueues on rotation).

Each `ReadyQueueEntry::kind` carries the discriminator. This is the
only multi-kind module in the current framework — PMU and TensorDump
are single-kind.

[`L2SwimlaneCollector`](../src/a2a3/platform/include/host/l2_swimlane_collector.h)
on a2a3 inherits from
[`profiling_common::ProfilerBase<L2SwimlaneCollector, L2SwimlaneModule>`](../src/common/platform/include/host/profiler_base.h):
the base class owns split mgmt threads, collector shards, and the
`BufferPoolManager<L2SwimlaneModule>` they share. `L2SwimlaneCollector`
supplies the L2-specific pieces — the `L2SwimlaneModule` trait
(notably `kBufferKinds = 4` and `kind_of()`), `initialize` that
allocates and pre-fills all four kinds of free queues, an
`on_buffer_collected` callback that branches on `info.type` across
`AICPU_TASK` / `AICPU_SCHED_PHASE` / `AICPU_ORCH_PHASE` / `AICORE_TASK`
to copy into the right per-core or per-thread vector, plus
`read_phase_header_metadata` /
`reconcile_counters` / `export_swimlane_json` / `finalize`. The
mgmt/collector threading and `Module` trait pattern are shared with
PMU and TensorDump — see
[profiling-framework.md](../profiling-framework.md) for the
framework reference.

### 5.3 a5 — same framework, host-shadow transport

a5's `L2SwimlaneCollector` derives from
`ProfilerBase<L2SwimlaneCollector, L2SwimlaneModule>` and uses the same
framework abstractions as a2a3, including the same split mgmt +
collector shard shape (`kMgmtDrainThreadCount` = `kCollectorThreadCount`
= `PLATFORM_MAX_AICPU_THREADS`, i.e. 7 on a5 vs 4 on a2a3). The
behavioral deviation from §5.2 is the **transport channel**: a5 has no
`halHostRegister`, so each device buffer is paired with a
host-shadow `malloc()` and the mgmt loop synchronizes the two via
`profiling_copy.h` (`rtMemcpy` onboard, plain `memcpy` in sim).

The AICore-side write target is a per-core, **stable**
`L2SwimlaneAicoreRing` (`dual_issue_slots[PLATFORM_L2_AICORE_RING_SIZE]`)
allocated once by the host and addressed via
`L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskPool::aicore_ring_ptr` (AICPU side) and
`KernelArgs::aicore_l2_swimlane_ring_addrs[block_idx]` forwarded into
`set_aicore_l2_swimlane_ring()` by `KERNEL_ENTRY` (AICore side). The ring
address never changes during a run, so AICore's write address is
decoupled from the AICPU's rotating `L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskBuffer`. Buffer rotation is
internal to `l2_swimlane_aicpu_complete_task` when `records[count]` hits
`PLATFORM_PROF_BUFFER_SIZE`. The runtime `Handshake` carries no
profiling fields.

The framework's `MemoryOps` therefore carries five callbacks on
a5 (`alloc` / `reg` / `free_` / `copy_to_device` /
`copy_from_device`); the mgmt loop mirrors the entire shm region
(`L2SwimlaneDataHeader` + per-core `L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskPool` +
`L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseHeader` + per-thread `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhasePool`)
device → host at the top of every tick, then pushes back only the
fields host actually modified (advanced `queue_heads[q]`, refilled
`free_queue.tail` and `buffer_ptrs[slot]`) via
`BufferPoolManager::write_range_to_device`. The bulk
`mirror_shm_to_device` is deliberately **not** called from the mgmt
loop: it would race with AICPU writes to device-only fields
(`current_buf_ptr`, `total/dropped/mismatch` counters, `queue_tails`,
`free_queue.head`, `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseHeader::magic`,
`L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseHeader::core_to_thread[]`) and roll them back to
whatever the host shadow held at the start of the tick. Per-buffer
payloads (`L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskBuffer` / `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseBuffer`)
are pulled on demand inside `ProfilerAlgorithms::process_entry` after
a popped ready-entry resolves to its host shadow. `BufferPoolManager`'s
`release_owned_buffers` frees the device pointer via the
collector's `release_fn` and the paired shadow via `std::free()`.

[`L2SwimlaneCollector`](../src/a5/platform/include/host/l2_swimlane_collector.h)
on a5 inherits the same CRTP base
([`profiling_common::ProfilerBase`](../src/common/platform/include/host/profiler_base.h))
as a2a3 and parameterizes
[`BufferPoolManager`](../src/common/platform/include/host/buffer_pool_manager.h)
with `L2SwimlaneModule` (`kBufferKinds = 2`). The only a5-specific
glue is the 5-callback `MemoryOps` and the per-tick shm mirror.

a5's per-thread AICPU flush hooks (`l2_swimlane_aicpu_flush` /
`l2_swimlane_aicpu_flush_phase_buffers`) are the only data path on the
records side — host never reads from `current_buf_ptr` to recover
records. `reconcile_counters` is purely passive: it logs an error if
any `current_buf_ptr` is non-zero with a non-empty buffer (a
device-flush bug), then runs the three-bucket cross-check
`collected + dropped + mismatch == device_total` per pool (PERF +
PHASE), same shape as a2a3.

## 6. Overhead

L2 swimlane is opt-in and zero-overhead when disabled — without
`--enable-l2-swimlane` neither host nor device allocates the L2
perf shared region and the timing-write code paths are skipped.

When enabled, the dominant per-task overhead is:

- `get_sys_cnt()` reads at task start / end on AICore.
- Two cache-line writes into the WIP slot.
- The AICPU commit on FIN, which copies the WIP record into the
  ring buffer plus a few metadata fields.

Phase-record overhead (only at `--enable-l2-swimlane >= 3`):

- a2a3 — one 40 B `L2SwimlaneAicpuSchedPhaseRecord` per work-emitting
  scheduler iteration (Complete + Dispatch, idle iters do not emit),
  plus one 32 B `L2SwimlaneAicpuOrchPhaseRecord` per `submit_task()`.
- a5 — one 40 B `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseRecord` per emitted phase
  (legacy unified shape).

Both architectures drain buffers concurrently with execution through the
ProfilerBase mgmt/collector pipeline; both a2a3 and a5 use split mgmt plus
collector shards for this profiler (a5 with 7 shards, a2a3 with 4). a5
additionally pays per-buffer `rtMemcpy`/`memcpy` round-trips to keep the
host shadow in sync, which overlap with device execution.

`--rounds > 1` collects only on the first round so the steady-state
benchmark is not perturbed.

## 7. Limitations

### 7.1 a2a3

- Records can be lost on device when both the per-core / per-thread
  free queue and the host's recycled pool are empty for too long.
  AICPU increments `dropped_record_count` and continues; the host's
  `reconcile_counters()` reports `collected + dropped == total` per
  pool. If `dropped > 0`, raise `PLATFORM_PROF_BUFFERS_PER_CORE` /
  `PLATFORM_PROF_{SCHED,ORCH}_BUFFERS_PER_THREAD` so the recycle pool has more
  headroom.
- A non-zero `current_buf_ptr` after `stop()` is logged as ERROR
  and never recovered — host treats device flush as the sole data
  path. Such a leftover indicates an AICPU flush bug, not a tail
  loss to tune around.
- `a2a3sim` exercises the export pipeline; the simulated device
  clock is not realistic for absolute-timing analysis. Use real
  hardware for steady-state numbers.

### 7.2 a5

- Each per-core `L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskBuffer` and per-thread `L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseBuffer` is
  fixed-size. Tasks past `PLATFORM_PROF_BUFFER_SIZE` per core (and
  phases past `PLATFORM_PHASE_RECORDS_PER_THREAD` per thread) are
  silently dropped via AICPU early return; the host surfaces the
  count in the finalize log line. Raise the constants in
  [platform_config.h](../src/a5/platform/include/common/platform_config.h)
  for workloads that exceed them.
- `a5sim` exercises the export pipeline; the simulated device
  clock is not realistic for absolute-timing analysis.

### 7.3 Common

- Only the **first** round records when `--rounds > 1` is in use.
- The current implementation captures incore-level scope only —
  L3 composition and orchestrator-internal sub-tasks are visible
  through the orchestrator phase summary, not as nested swimlane
  scopes.

## 8. FAQ / Debug Guide

**No `l2_swimlane_records.json` produced.** Check that
`--enable-l2-swimlane` was passed. Verify `<output_prefix>` exists
in the run log; if `--rounds > 1`, only the first round records.

**`merged_swimlane.json` is missing.** `swimlane_converter` runs
automatically after a SceneTest with `--enable-l2-swimlane`; if it
did not, run it manually:

```bash
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/l2_swimlane_records.json
```

**All tasks show as `task(rXtY)` (undistinguished).** No `deps.json`
was available, so the converter could not resolve `func_id` (it's
`-1` on disk) and every lane falls back to the anonymous `task(rXtY)`
label with no dependency arrows. Re-run with `--enable-dep-gen`, or
drop a `deps.json` from a prior `dep_gen` capture next to the records
and re-run the converter — see
[§3.5](#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen).

**Tasks show as `func_<id>` instead of human names.** `deps.json`
resolved the `func_id`, but the CALLABLE spec lacks `"name"` fields
or `name_map_<case>.json` was not produced. See [profiling-name-map.md](../profiling-name-map.md).

**Some tasks missing from the swimlane.** Likely dropped on device
because the buffer pool ran out. On a2a3 check
`reconcile_counters()` output for non-zero `dropped`; raise
`PLATFORM_PROF_BUFFERS_PER_CORE` /
`PLATFORM_PROF_{SCHED,ORCH}_BUFFERS_PER_THREAD`. On a5 raise
`PLATFORM_PROF_BUFFER_SIZE`.

**`current_buf_ptr` non-empty at finalize on a2a3.** The host logs
this as ERROR and does not recover. AICPU did not flush its
active L2 swimlane buffer at run end. Check the AICPU flush path runs
for every thread that produced records.

**Phase records empty.** Either the runtime did not emit phase
data (only `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` does, and only when phase init
ran — on a2a3 gated on
`L2SwimlaneDataHeader::num_sched_phase_threads > 0` (sched) or
`num_orch_phase_threads > 0` (orch); on a5 gated on
`L2SwimlaneAicpuPhaseHeader::magic`), or the host did not pre-zero
those fields. Verify the runtime calls `l2_swimlane_aicpu_init_phase()`
in its scheduler init path; check the host's
`L2SwimlaneCollector::initialize` zero-inits the relevant metadata
fields.

**`dispatch_time_us` < `finish_time_us` mismatch.** Verify the runtime
overwrites `task_id` with the full encoding on FIN
(`tensormap_and_ringbuffer` does
`(ring_id << 32) | local_id`); a half-filled record means AICore
wrote the WIP slot but AICPU never committed.

**Scheduler-overhead deep-dive missing from converter output.**
The converter runs `sched_overhead_analysis` only when a device
log is resolvable. Pass `-d <device-id>` or place a `device-*`
log under `outputs/` close in time to the `l2_swimlane_records.json`
mtime; see `simpler_setup/tools/README.md` for the resolver
rules.
