# Investigations

Write-ups of work that was done to **answer a question** and where the
answer wasn't a code change that lives in the repo. Specifically:

- Optimizations that were considered, measured, and dropped (no signal /
  not worth the complexity).
- Designs that were prototyped and rejected.
- "I think we should do X" proposals where the analysis ruled out X
  (or scoped X to "later, when Y is true").

The point is to save the **next** person's time. If you find yourself
reaching for the same idea, the entry tells you:

1. It was already considered.
2. What measurement / argument shut it down.
3. Under what conditions it might become worth re-opening.

If you re-investigate anyway, update the entry with the new data —
don't open a parallel doc.

## What does NOT go here

- **Active bugs / unresolved problems** → `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (local) or a
  GitHub issue.
- **Problems with a known fix or workaround** →
  `docs/troubleshooting/`.
- **Designs that were prototyped and shipped** → the design doc lives
  with the subsystem (e.g. `docs/dfx/<feature>.md`).
- **Architectural decisions that constrain future code** → if/when we
  adopt ADRs, those would live elsewhere; this folder is for things we
  *didn't* do.

## File naming

`YYYY-MM-<short-slug>.md` — e.g. `2026-06-l2-swimlane-defer-wmb.md`.
The date is the month the investigation was done so entries sort
chronologically and stale ones are easy to spot.

## Template

```markdown
# <Title — what was proposed, in one line>

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Verdict**: dropped / deferred-pending-X / superseded-by-Y

## Question

Brief statement of the proposal. Why it might be a good idea — the
intuition that would make a future contributor reach for the same
change.

## What was tried

Concrete actions. Commands, files touched, measurement setup. Enough
that someone can reproduce the measurement, not enough to retell the
whole codebase.

## Result

The numbers, the diff size, the bug found — whatever the actual output
of the investigation was.

## Why not (now)

The decision. Tie it to a specific signal in the result, not just
preference.

## When to reconsider

The condition under which this becomes worth re-opening. "If workload X
shows >Y µs in profile" / "after Z lands" / "if hardware changes such
that ...".

## References

- PRs, commits, issue links.
- Related rules (`.claude/rules/...`) or docs that informed the
  decision.

- [2026-07 — A5 跨 cluster `last_task_alive` 优化计划（衍生自 PR 906）](2026-07-a5-last-task-alive-cross-cluster.md) — deferred-pending-A5-onboard-measurement：A5 默认 `ALLOWED_CPUS={5,6,7,8,3}` 让 orch 与全部 sched 跨 die，每任务 orch 跨 die acquire-load `last_task_alive`（开销未测量、未记录）。PR 906 整体不可直接合（被 #1263 等走偏、A5 无实测收益），但其 M5 思路（限制 SM 写者为单一与 orch 同 die 的线程）正中要害。筛出 4 个方案按 D→B-0→B→C 推进，每项落前先跑 before/after 真机对比。Scheme D（✅ 已实现 a5 + 单测）：实现时查清 `cleanup_retired` 的真实根因是 slot 复用时 task 链混入更晚任务的 entry、cleanup 误释放存活 entry（PR 906 的「范围 cap」治标不治本），改为按 `producer_task_id` 选择性释放；a2a3 同病待镜像。B-0/B/C 仍待上机测量
- [2026-07 — Containing A2/A3 SDMA stream teardown after an AICore fault](2026-07-a2a3-sdma-fault-teardown.md) — CANN exposes no remote-channel retirement fence: even device-confirmed stream frees followed by a soft-reset success that did not complete context teardown can add minutes to a later ordinary fault. Contained by making SDMA an explicit per-Worker opt-in (`enable_sdma`) so only opt-in Workers carry the slow teardown and ordinary Workers keep fast recovery; full closure needs CANN runtime + driver changes (#1425)
- [2026-07 — AICore-side arg fill for ALL dispatches (not just the gated path)](2026-07-aicore-fills-all-args-ready-path.md) — measured & rejected for the ready path: making the AICore fill its own `args[]` for every task adds ~1.0 µs to each task's `receive→start` setup (paged_attention_unroll: 349 ns → 1356 ns), because a ready task has no idle doorbell gate to hide the fill. Offload is a win only on `not_ready` (early-dispatch), where the AICore already spins at the gate; shipped design keeps the AICPU filling ready tasks (#1328)
- [2026-07 — L2 swimlane AICore: switch-overhead source + FIN-early reorder & ACK-gate](2026-07-aicore-swimlane-switch-overhead-and-ack-gate.md) — measured: the ~0.8 µs inter-task switch is the record write-back `dcci(record,OUT)+dsb` (~0.5 µs) + payload setup (~0.28 µs), inherent and not reducible by moving FIN; the WAIT gap (p99 ~700 µs) dominates decode. Shipped: sample `end_time` after an early FIN, and an AICPU ACK-gate on buffer rotation (release the old buffer only when AICore ACKs the new buffer's first task) to close the FIN-before-record boundary race the reorder introduced
- [2026-07 — Removing PTO2LocalReadyBuffer exposed a missing dcci in EP dispatch](2026-07-local-buffer-removal-ep-combine-regression.md) — RESOLVED in #1245: local-buffer removal changed dispatch timing and unmasked a latent kernel bug (dispatch never dcci'd `recv_count_out` to HBM → local_expert read count=0 → all-zero output); fixed with a one-line dcci in the example kernel
- [2026-06 — Gating the two residual profiling enable() calls on the orch/scheduler hot path](2026-06-orch-profiling-enable-gates-hot-path.md) — gated under existing `SIMPLER_DFX`; magnitude unmeasured, no new macro
