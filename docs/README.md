# simpler Documentation

Index of every document under `docs/`, grouped by what you are trying to do.
The top-level [README](../README.md) links only the handful of entry-point docs;
this page is the complete map.

These pages are also published as a searchable site at
<https://hw-native-sys.github.io/simpler/>, which adds a generated API reference
for `simpler.worker`, `simpler.task_interface` and `simpler.orchestrator`. The
site is built by `.github/workflows/docs.yml`; `mkdocs.yml` owns its navigation,
so a new page needs a `nav` entry there as well as a row here.

New docs belong in one of the groups below, and in a subdirectory when the group
already has one (`dfx/`, `hardware/`, `troubleshooting/`, `investigations/`).
Add the row here in the same commit — an unlisted doc is invisible.

**File names are kebab-case** (`chip-level-arch.md`), including when the doc is
named after a code identifier that uses underscores.

## Start here

Two audiences use this tree. If you are **building on** simpler — writing
kernels and orchestration, running and measuring them — start at
**[user/](user/README.md)**, which routes you through install → first run →
write a kernel → profile → debug. Everything else here is written for people
changing simpler's own internals.
