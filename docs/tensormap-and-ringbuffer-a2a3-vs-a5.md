## Comparison Boundary and Classification

The direct comparison covers tracked files under
`src/{a2a3,a5}/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/`, matched by relative path.
There are 53 paths present on both platforms and two additional paths present
only on A5. Every file in that boundary belongs to exactly one of these three
categories:

| Category | Count | Definition |
| -------- | ----: | ---------- |
| Byte-identical | 24 | The files at the same relative path have identical bytes |
| Compile-time or non-functional differences | 11 | Text differs, but the generated runtime behavior and data semantics are equivalent |
| Functional differences | 20 | Eighteen matching paths and two A5-only paths encode or document differences in runtime behavior, capacity, diagnostics, or supported backends |

A file is classified as functional when any part of its diff changes behavior,
even if the same diff also contains include-order, comment, or formatting
changes. Files outside the direct boundary, such as platform configuration and
PMU collector implementations, are cited only as supporting evidence.

## Byte-Identical Files

The following 24 files are byte-identical:

```text
build_config.py
docs/{SCALAR_DATA_ACCESS.md,SUBMIT_BY_CLUSTER.md,device_log_profiling.md,profiling_levels.md}
host/{dep_gen_replay.cpp,runtime_compile_info.cpp}
orchestration/{common.cpp,arg_with_deps.h,orchestration_api.h}
runtime/{common.h,async_kernel_api.h,dep_compute.h,orchestrator.h,
         runtime_core.cpp,runtime_core.h,shared_memory.h,tensormap.h,
         tensor_create_info.h}
runtime/scheduler/{scheduler.cpp,scheduler_types.h}
runtime/shared/{shared_memory.cpp,tensormap.cpp,runtime.cpp}
```

Byte identity is a textual result only. A shared file may still consume
platform-specific constants or APIs supplied by files outside this comparison
boundary.

## Compile-Time or Non-Functional Differences

The following 11 matching paths differ textually without changing runtime
behavior:

| Files | Difference |
| ----- | ---------- |
| `common/runtime_status.h`, `host/dep_gen_replay.h`, `runtime/constants.h` | Path-derived include-guard macro names only |
| `runtime/backend/sdma/sdma_completion_kernel.h`, `runtime/types.h` | `#pragma once` on A2/A3 versus a path-derived include guard on A5 |
| `common/intrinsic.h` | A5 uses `s_block_idx` and `s_block_num` because the unprefixed names are compiler-reserved; getter semantics and layout are unchanged |
| `runtime/dispatch_payload.h` | Comments follow the platform-specific `LocalContext` field names; payload semantics are unchanged |
| `runtime/aicore_completion_mailbox.h` | Path-derived include guards and comment wording only |
| `runtime/completion_token.h` | Path-derived include guards and an A2/A3-only explanatory comment |
| `runtime/runtime_types.h` | Comments state the corresponding 72- or 108-worker capacity; the mask remains two 64-bit words on both platforms |
| `runtime/submit_types.h` | The launch accessor and backing field are named `block_num` on A2/A3 and `core_num` on A5; both represent the logical SPMD block count |

The first two rows, covering five files, are the strict "compile macro only"
subset. The `s_block_*` names are also a compile-time constraint rather than a
different runtime data model. No standalone cleanup is planned; mechanical
include guards can converge to `#pragma once` when those files are next
modified.

## Files with Functional Differences

The following 18 matching paths have at least one functional difference:

```text
aicore/aicore_executor.cpp
aicpu/aicpu_executor.cpp
docs/MULTI_RING.md
docs/RUNTIME_LOGIC.md
host/runtime_maker.cpp
runtime/aicore_completion_mailbox_types.h
runtime/backend/sdma/sdma_completion_scheduler.h
runtime/async_wait.h
runtime/orchestrator.cpp
runtime/ring_buffer.cpp
runtime/ring_buffer.h
runtime/runtime.h
runtime/scheduler/scheduler.h
runtime/scheduler/scheduler_cold_path.cpp
runtime/scheduler/scheduler_completion.cpp
runtime/scheduler/scheduler_context.h
runtime/scheduler/scheduler_dispatch.cpp
runtime/shared/runtime_init.cpp
```

A5 also has two backend files with no A2/A3 counterpart:

```text
runtime/backend/urma/urma_completion_kernel.h
runtime/backend/urma/urma_completion_scheduler.h
```

The functional differences group into the following themes:

| Difference | Root cause | Must remain platform-specific? | Current decision |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Compute topology | Physical hardware | Yes | Retain each platform's capacity constants and derived layouts |
| AICPU launch plan | Product thread limits, CANN launch ABI, and firmware topology | Yes | Retain the A5 dynamic topology query; do not equate thread limits with physical topology |
| Cache coherence | Hardware coherence model | Yes | Retain the required invalidate/flush operations on A2/A3; do not copy unnecessary maintenance operations to A5 |
| PMU collection | Hardware PMU and platform collection protocol | Yes | Retain the different counter counts, readers, and FIN submission paths |
| System counter and DMB | Hardware timing and register layout | Yes | Use the constants for each platform |
| URMA completion | A5-specific implementation and product capability gate | Yes, for now | Retain the A5 path; do not claim that URMA is available in the default build |
| Next-block prefetch | A2/A3-only performance optimization | No | Retain on A2/A3; validate on A5 before considering a port |
| Scheduler progress publication | AICPU topology and measured publication cost | No | Retain A5's 16-task batching; keep per-advance publication on A2/A3, where the portable implementation showed no significant benefit |
| Terminal deferred release | Measured end-of-run Scheduler release cost | No | Keep the current experiment scoped to A5; A2/A3 traces do not show the same large terminal release stall |
| Fatal teardown | Software reliability strategy | No | Retain the current implementations; decide whether to converge after measuring the worst-case A5 teardown time |
| Scheduler trace attribution | Software diagnostic strategy | No | Preserve the current traces; converge only after comparing generated timelines |

### Compute Topology and AICPU Launch Plan

One A2/A3 runtime device corresponds to one die with 24 clusters, comprising
24 AICs and 48 AIVs. An A3 chip exposes its two dies as two device IDs. One A5
runtime device instead spans both dies of the chip and has 36 clusters,
comprising 36 AICs and 72 AIVs. Because the physical core and cluster counts
visible to one runtime device differ, `PLATFORM_MAX_CORES`,
`RUNTIME_MAX_WORKER`, and the capacities of per-core diagnostic buffers must
also differ.

In the current product configuration, A2/A3 uses at most four active AICPU
threads, while A5 uses at most five. `DeviceRuntimeLaunchDesc` retains
`aicpu_launch_count` on both platforms. A5 uses
`simpler_aicpu_query_topology` to determine the launch plan dynamically from
OCCUPY/FG/PG/SMT, whereas A2/A3 does not currently use the same dynamic query
path.

Physical topology, product thread limits, and firmware launch topology are
three related but distinct constraints. The physical core count determines the
runtime capacity ceiling, while the AICPU thread limit and topology query
determine how the current product launches and shards the scheduler. They are
not interchangeable.

| File | Role |
| ---- | ---- |
| `platform/include/common/platform_config.h` | Defines cluster/core counts, the product AICPU thread limit, and platform capacity constants |
| `runtime/runtime.h` | Maps `RUNTIME_MAX_WORKER` to 72/108 platform cores and defines the shared launch descriptor |
| `host/runtime_maker.cpp` | A5 registers and uses the dynamic topology query; A2/A3 does not use this path |

### Cache Coherence

On A2/A3, after Host DMA or SDMA writes to GM, the AICPU must invalidate its
cache before reading the data. On A5, DMA/HBM is coherent with the AICPU, so
these invalidations are unnecessary at the same points. The current SDMA
completion protocol publishes a monotonic completed post ID: both platforms
read it with acquire semantics and neither clears or retires the shared record.
AICore results are still published by the AICore with `dcci`.

This cache maintenance directly guarantees visibility. It cannot be
mechanically removed from A2/A3, nor should it be copied to A5 as unnecessary
overhead.

| File | Current difference |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| `aicpu/aicpu_executor.cpp` | A2/A3 invalidates `runtime->dev`, which Host DMA writes, before teardown; A5 does not require the corresponding operation |
| `runtime/backend/sdma/sdma_completion_scheduler.h` | A2/A3 invalidates the cache line before the acquire load of the completed post ID; A5 performs the acquire load directly; retirement is a no-op on both platforms |
| `runtime/async_wait.h` | A2/A3 provides a cache-line invalidation helper for async COUNTER polling; A5 does not require it |
| `runtime/scheduler/scheduler.h` | A2/A3 invalidates the cache line before async COUNTER polling; A5 polls directly |

### PMU, System Counter, and DMB

A2/A3 exposes eight PMU counters, which the AICPU reads from MMIO after FIN.
A5 exposes ten counters, which the AICore reads with the PTO-ISA `ld_dev`
operation and writes to a per-core staging slot before the AICPU submits the
record after FIN. The counter counts, MMIO readers, and available instructions
differ, so the record layout, FIN sequencing, and per-core ring must diverge.

The A2/A3 system counter runs at 50 MHz and uses DMB MMIO offset `0xA0`; the A5
values are 1 GHz and `0xD0`, respectively. These facts come from each
platform's `platform/include/common/platform_config.h`.
`docs/RUNTIME_LOGIC.md` only documents the corresponding mapping.

| File | Current difference |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| `platform/include/common/platform_config.h` | Defines the system counter frequency and DMB offset for each platform |
| `aicore/aicore_executor.cpp` | Both platforms bracket kernel execution with the PMU gate; A5 additionally writes the ten-counter staging record before FIN |
| `runtime/scheduler/scheduler_completion.cpp` | After FIN, A2/A3 invokes the AICPU MMIO reader for eight counters; A5 commits the ten-counter slot written by the AICore |
| `platform/shared/aicpu/pmu_collector_aicpu.cpp` | Implements the A2/A3 direct MMIO read and the A5 staging-slot consumption paths |

### Optional A5-Specific URMA Backend

A5 contains the source path for issuing URMA completion requests, creating
deferred entries, forwarding FIN, and polling/retiring CQ entries. A2/A3
currently registers only the COUNTER and SDMA completion backends.

The repository does not currently define `PTO_URMA_SUPPORTED`. A5 therefore
compiles the shared ABI, mailbox, CQ polling/retirement, and related paths, but
the kernel path that successfully issues URMA PTO instructions is unreachable.
The current state is "implemented but disabled by default." It neither means
that the default A5 build supports URMA nor proves that the A2/A3 hardware does
not support URMA.

Both platforms already share `CompletionToken::backend_cookie`,
`ASYNC_ENGINE_URMA`, the 32-byte `DeferredCompletionEntry`, end-to-end cookie
propagation from the AICore slab into the 64-byte mailbox message, and the
generic completion-backend dispatch. The actual platform divergence is that
A2/A3 lacks the URMA completion type, request-issue implementation, registered
backend operations, and CQ polling/retirement path.

| Path stage | File | Current difference |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| Request issue | `runtime/backend/urma/urma_completion_kernel.h` | Present only on A5; it invokes `TGET_ASYNC`/`TPUT_ASYNC` only when `PTO_URMA_SUPPORTED` is defined |
| Deferred entry | `runtime/aicore_completion_mailbox_types.h`, `runtime/async_kernel_api.h` | Both platforms use the same 32-byte entry and propagate `backend_cookie`; A5 additionally defines the URMA completion type |
| FIN forwarding | `runtime/scheduler/scheduler_completion.cpp`, `runtime/aicore_completion_mailbox.h` | Both platforms carry `backend_cookie` into the same 64-byte mailbox message; A5 can populate it with URMA workspace metadata |
| CQ polling/retirement | `runtime/backend/urma/urma_completion_scheduler.h`, `runtime/async_wait.h` | A5 registers URMA operations, polls CQE owner/status, advances the CQ/WQ tail, and updates the doorbell; the scheduler header itself is not guarded by the capability macro |

### A2/A3 Next-Block Prefetch

The A2/A3 completion path calls `prefetch_block_dst()` in
`runtime/scheduler/scheduler_completion.cpp`; the corresponding helper is
declared in `runtime/scheduler/scheduler_context.h`. This prefetch reduces the
A2/A3 sync-start drain burst without changing the scheduling protocol.

Prefetch effectiveness depends strongly on platform characteristics such as
cache capacity. The repository does not contain an A5 measurement that
establishes a benefit, so the optimization should not be ported mechanically.
This is a platform-sensitive performance strategy, not a different scheduler
architecture.

### Scheduler Progress Publication: Why A5 Only

A2/A3 publishes `ring->fc.last_task_alive` after every local ring-pointer
advance. A5 tracks `last_published_to_sm` and publishes the shared watermark
every 16 local advances while no reclaim consumer is blocked. This reduces
Scheduler-to-Orchestrator cache-line transfers while allowing the shared
watermark to trail local reclamation by at most 15 tasks on the non-blocking
path.

The optimization is portable, but its benefit is topology-specific. A2/A3 has
four physical AICPU cores per cluster and runs four active roles by default
(`1 Orchestrator + 3 Schedulers`). Its affinity policy prefers one cluster that
can hold all four roles, so progress publication is normally cluster-local. A5
has two physical AICPU cores per cluster and runs five active roles by default
(`1 Orchestrator + 4 Schedulers`). Even with SMT, those five roles cannot all
fit in one cluster. They must span clusters and, depending on SMT and the
available CPU pool, may span dies.

Any A5 Scheduler may win `advance_lock`, advance the authoritative
Scheduler-side `last_task_alive`, and publish `ring->fc.last_task_alive` for the
Orchestrator. A remote publisher transfers or invalidates a cache line that the
Orchestrator repeatedly reads for slot, heap, and TensorMap reclamation. K=16
does not remove Scheduler-to-Scheduler contention on `advance_lock`; it reduces
the frequency of Scheduler-to-Orchestrator publication by up to 16x.

| Property | A2/A3 | A5 |
| -------- | ----- | -- |
| Physical AICPU cores per cluster | 4 | 2 |
| Default active roles | 1 Orchestrator + 3 Schedulers = 4 | 1 Orchestrator + 4 Schedulers = 5 |
| Normal placement | All active roles fit in one cluster | Active roles must span clusters and may span dies |
| Shared-watermark publication | Normally cluster-local | Can require cross-cluster or cross-die cache-line transfer |
| Port benchmark | Mean Effective change `-0.24%`; all workloads within approximately +/-2% | Mean Effective change `-2.81%`; all eight workloads improved |
| Decision | Keep per-advance publication | Enable K=16 batching |

A5 force-publishes when the local watermark reaches `current_task_index` or an
orchestrator reclaim consumer has observed no reclaim progress for 10 ms and
requests an exact watermark. Task-slot, heap, dependency-list, fanin-spill, and
TensorMap pressure then set per-ring request bits; scheduler thread 0 services
them under `advance_lock` from both productive and idle iterations, publishes
the local watermark, and acknowledges completion. Structural deadlock checks
run only after this acknowledgment, so their reclaim head is not a batched
lower bound. These request bits are cache-line-isolated from scheduler
lock-contention retries, which remain deferred to idle loops. K=16 batching is
enabled only after all reclaim request/ack pointers are wired to the current
scheduler; incomplete wiring keeps per-advance publication. Initialization,
arena relocation, and ring reuse reset local progress and disable batching
until that validation succeeds again.

This pressure handshake follows the same liveness rule recorded in
[`2026-06-cross-task-batched-publish.md`](investigations/2026-06-cross-task-batched-publish.md):
delaying a publication is safe only while no peer is waiting on it for forward
progress.

| File | A5-only difference introduced by PR #1575 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `runtime/pto_ring_buffer.{h,cpp}` | A5 reclaim consumers request and await exact watermark publication after 10 ms without progress and before structural classification |
| `runtime/orchestrator.cpp` | A5 TensorMap pressure requests publication from every ring after the same 10 ms no-progress interval |
| `runtime/scheduler/{scheduler.h,scheduler_dispatch.cpp}` | A5 batches non-blocking publication at K=16 and services pressure requests in productive and idle loops; A2/A3 continues to publish every local advance |
| `runtime/shared/runtime_init.cpp` | A5 initializes, resets, and wires the publication shadow and pressure handshake |

The A2/A3 result is not a correctness limitation. A local port passed targeted
and complete non-hardware tests, but its eight workload deltas were all within
the approximately +/-2% noise band, with an unweighted mean of `-0.24%`.
Batching would therefore add up to 15 tasks of non-blocking reclamation lag
without a demonstrated payoff. The same-device A5
measurements instead showed lower Effective time in all eight workloads, with
an unweighted mean reduction of `2.81%`. Full A2/A3 measurements are recorded
in the [PR benchmark follow-up](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/pull/1575#issuecomment-5310909143).

### Terminal Deferred Release: A5 Experiment Scope

The terminal deferred-release experiment is currently A5-only. A5 swimlanes
showed Scheduler time extending beyond useful work while a large accumulated
release backlog updated task reference counts and advanced ring reclamation at
the end of a run. The corresponding A2/A3 traces reviewed for this work did
not show a comparable block of terminal release work, so there is no measured
A2/A3 bottleneck for this optimization to address.

On A5, the experiment keeps exact per-task release while orchestration can
still create work. Once orchestration is sealed, Schedulers may discard their
local deferred-release backlogs at existing release boundaries. After every
task has completed and all Schedulers leave dispatch, the last thread at a
terminal barrier closes the remaining live ring slots in one pass and
publishes the final ring state. Errors and non-terminal exits retain exact
per-task lifecycle handling.

The A5 benchmark covers seven workloads for 100 rounds and Qwen3 for five
rounds. No workload regressed by 5% in Orchestrator time. Batch Paged Attention,
the workload that exposed the terminal release cost, changed from
`5918.916 us` on the refreshed A5 Main baseline to `5819.991 us` with the
experiment (`-1.67%`). The same experiment had measured `6947.106 us` before
restoring the Main Scheduler entry gate, which also demonstrates that hot-code
layout must be preserved when evaluating the lifecycle optimization.

These results establish an A5 optimization target, not a platform-independent
policy. A2/A3 keeps its existing release behavior unless a future A2/A3
swimlane shows the same terminal release bottleneck and a separate benchmark
demonstrates a benefit.

### Fatal Teardown

The A2/A3 scheduler uses a dedicated fatal latch to elect an owner, broadcasts
EXIT to all AICores that completed the handshake, and then joins them in
parallel against a single deadline. A5 uses `completed_` to elect the owner and
deinitializes each core sequentially.

The A2/A3 implementation mitigates failure scenarios involving 48 SDMA remote
streams, but the hardware, PTO-ISA, and platform ABI do not mandate this
algorithm. The current A5 sequential deinitialization does not omit the
acknowledgement wait and is therefore not a known correctness defect. The risk
is that each unresponsive core may consume a one-second timeout, so the
aggregate teardown time can reach or exceed the AICPU operation-execution
timeout.

The current implementations are retained. The total teardown time for N
unresponsive cores should first be measured on A5. If a port is needed, the A5
handshake, EXIT MMIO, shared deadline, and core deinitialization semantics must
then be validated. See
[Issue #1710](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/issues/1710) for tracking.

| File | Current difference |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| `runtime/scheduler/scheduler_cold_path.cpp` | A2/A3 uses a fatal latch, broadcasts EXIT, and uses a shared deadline; A5 uses a `completed_` owner and deinitializes each core sequentially |
| `runtime/scheduler/scheduler_context.h` | A2/A3 declares fatal-owner election and broadcast/join helpers; A5 retains its existing emergency-shutdown interface |

### Scheduler Trace Attribution

The scheduler implementations expose the same scheduling protocol, but their
DFX trace bookkeeping is not byte-equivalent. In
`runtime/scheduler/scheduler_dispatch.cpp`, A2/A3 advances the scheduler phase
anchor across idle iterations, while A5 leaves idle gaps for post-processing to
reconstruct. The two versions also use different local spellings for some
phase-state references. These differences affect generated diagnostic
timelines, not task scheduling or completion semantics.

Trace output should be compared before converging this code, because a
mechanical copy could change how idle time is attributed in Perfetto without
changing runtime execution.

## Excluded Scope: Examples and Tests

`examples/.../tensormap_and_ringbuffer` and
`tests/st/.../tensormap_and_ringbuffer` are outside the runtime implementation
comparison. Examples and tests unique to either platform primarily reflect
chip-feature validation and test-porting progress; they cannot be used to
infer whether the runtime supports a shared algorithm.

For example, A5 has `urma_deferred_completion_demo`, but this does not mean
that the current build defines `PTO_URMA_SUPPORTED`. Likewise, the absence of a
workload on one platform does not automatically mean that the corresponding
runtime capability is unavailable.
