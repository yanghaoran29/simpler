# AICPU Kernel Launch Mechanisms

How a host process makes a custom AICPU SO runnable on the device. There
are **three known methods** in CANN; this repo's runtime uses one of
them, the tool at
[`tools/cann-examples/aicpu-kernel-launch/`](../tools/cann-examples/aicpu-kernel-launch/)
implements the same one as a standalone reference, and a third was
attempted in PR #537 but is unusable due to a CANN-side cache coherency
bug ([issue #822](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/issues/822)).

This doc records all three so the failure lore from #822 doesn't have
to be re-derived if anyone reaches for Path B again.

## Comparison

| Method | Where the SO lands | Sudo? | Multi-runtime per process? | Iterative dev? | Status |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| **1. tar.gz pre-deployment** | `/usr/lib64/aicpu_kernels/.../` at CANN install time | Yes (root-owned) | Yes | No — redeploy per change | Works, but obsolete for this repo |
| **2. Path A — dispatcher Mode A bootstrap** | `/usr/lib64/aicpu_kernels/0/aicpu_kernels_device/simpler_inner_<fp>_<dev>.so` written at runtime by the AICPU OS process | No | **No** (one SO per host process — see "Path A latch") | Yes | **Production runtime + reference tool** |
| **3. Path B — `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_CUSTOM`** | `/home/CustAiCpuUser/cust_aicpu_<dev>_<vf>_<pid>/` written by the `aicpu_custom_scheduler` subprocess | No | Yes (latch lifted) | Yes | **Broken** — cust subprocess L1 stale on AICore HBM writes (#822) |

The columns above frame the trade-offs. The rest of this doc explains
each row, then the failure forensics for Path B.

## Method 1: tar.gz pre-deployment (classical)

Ship the inner SO inside a CANN custom-AICPU tarball. The tarball is
extracted into `/usr/lib64/aicpu_kernels/` at CANN install time (or by
the operator running an unpack script). At runtime CANN loads it as if
it were a built-in kernel.

- **Mechanism**: out-of-band file deployment, no special API
- **Deploy time**: install-time, requires root (destination is
  root-owned); for dev iteration the operator has to redeploy the tar
  by hand
- **Multi-runtime**: works fine. The CANN-side `firstCreatSo_` one-shot
  latch (see Path A) is bypassed because the SO was already loaded
  during CANN's own init — there's no second `SaveSoFile` call to
  silently no-op
- **Cache coherency**: not affected. The kernel runs inside the main
  `aicpu_scheduler` cluster, which shares an L1 snoop domain with
  AICore HBM writes
- **Used by**: pre-2024 CANN AICPU custom kernels and any environment
  that has a fleet provisioning pipeline. Not used by this repo —
  iterative development on shared dev boxes makes sudo + per-change
  redeploy a non-starter

## Method 2: Path A — Mode A dispatcher bootstrap (this repo)

The host wraps an inner SO's bytes inside a `DeviceArgs` payload and
invokes
`rtAicpuKernelLaunchExWithArgs(KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_KFC, "AST_DYN_AICPU", ..., "libaicpu_extend_kernels.so")`.
CANN's preinstalled `libaicpu_extend_kernels.so` dlopens the dispatcher
SO inside the AICPU OS process; the dispatcher writes the inner SO
bytes to
`/usr/lib64/aicpu_kernels/0/aicpu_kernels_device/simpler_inner_<fp>_<dev>.so`,
then returns. The host then issues a normal
`rtsBinaryLoadFromFile(json, ...)` + `rtsFuncGetByName` +
`rtsLaunchCpuKernel` sequence pointing at the preinstall basename.

- **Mechanism**: AICPU OS process has write access to the preinstall
  subtree even though the directory is root-owned (the AICPU OS runs
  with a CANN-managed uid that holds the write capability). The host
  process itself never touches the filesystem destination
- **Deploy time**: at runtime, no operator action
- **Sudo**: not needed — the file write happens device-side
- **Multi-runtime — Path A latch**: this is the core limitation.
  CANN's preinstalled `libaicpu_processer.so` (the AICPU OS scheduler
  driving `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_KFC`) holds a process-wide
  `BackendServerHandleManager::firstCreatSo_` one-shot latch inside
  `SaveSoFile`. The first successful `SaveSoFile` flips the latch;
  subsequent calls return success **without writing the SO**, so a
  second runtime's inner SO load silently no-ops, and the second
  runtime's kernel either fails to load or runs the first runtime's
  code. **Within one host process you can ship exactly one inner SO
  via Path A.** This forces this repo's
  [`ChipWorker`](../src/common/worker/) model: one host process binds
  one (arch, runtime) pair; multi-runtime work fans out across
  processes
- **Cache coherency**: not affected. Same cluster as AICore snoop
  domain, same as Method 1
- **Used by**: this repo's production runtime
  (`src/{a2a3,a5}/runtime/.../host/runtime_maker.cpp`); the
  [`aicpu-kernel-launch`](../tools/cann-examples/aicpu-kernel-launch/)
  reference tool; and the
  [`aicpu-device-query`](../tools/cann-examples/aicpu-device-query/)
  probe tool

The dispatcher exports three symbols
(`StaticTileFwkBackendKernelServer` +
`DynTileFwkBackendKernelServerInit` +
`DynTileFwkBackendKernelServer`) — see
[`src/common/aicpu_loader/device/`](../src/common/aicpu_loader/device/)
for the symbol-level contract.

### Bootstrap ABI vs per-task launch ABI

There are two similarly shaped but separate argument channels in the current
onboard Path A implementation:

1. **Dispatcher bootstrap private ABI.**
   `LoadAicpuOp::BootstrapDispatcher()` builds a private argument blob for
   `rtAicpuKernelLaunchExWithArgs(KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_KFC, ...)` and writes a
   `device_args_ptr` at offset 40. The dispatcher reads that pointer as an
   extended `DeviceArgs` object carrying dispatcher SO bytes, inner runtime SO
   bytes, and `device_id`. This ABI belongs only to bootstrap and is kept in
   `src/common/aicpu_loader/{host,device}`.
2. **AICPU per-task launch ABI.**
   The per-task launch hands the front-less `KernelArgs` payload directly to
   `rtsLaunchCpuKernel()` (`cpu_args.baseArgs.args = &kernel_args.args`,
   `argsSize = sizeof(KernelArgs)`). There is no CANN launch front on this
   path — `runtime_args` sits at offset 0 and the AICPU entry reads it directly.
   Two sibling entries reuse the same launch mechanism with their own, smaller
   payloads instead of `KernelArgs`:
   - `simpler_aicpu_init` takes an `InitArgs` (device id + log config), launched
     once per device at `ensure_device_initialized` time. It latches the
     per-device invariants into the resident AICPU SO globals, so `exec` and
     `register_callable` no longer re-push them.
   - `simpler_aicpu_register_callable` takes a `RegisterCallableArgs` (orch-SO
     descriptor extracted from `Runtime`), launched per callable on the
     device-orchestration prepare path so the AICPU (re)dlopens its orch SO. hbg
     is a no-op (host-side orchestration).
3. **Shared per-task `KernelArgs` payload.**
   `src/{a2a3,a5}/platform/include/common/kernel_args.h` is front-less.
   Runtime state is passed through `KernelArgs::runtime_args`, profiling buffer
   bases, and register tables. AICore receives only this payload through the
   host-owned device copy. Per-device invariants (device id, log config) are NOT
   on `KernelArgs` — they travel once via `InitArgs`.

Keep those channels distinct. The bootstrap ABI still uses the `DeviceArgs`
name because the dispatcher really reads that structure. The platform per-task
ABI passes only the front-less `KernelArgs` and carries no CANN launch front.

The per-task launch buffer is exactly the front-less `KernelArgs`:

```text
KernelArgs + 0:  runtime_args
KernelArgs + 8:  regs
```

An earlier revision wrapped this payload behind a 48-byte CANN launch front
(`AicpuLaunchArgs`, an opaque pointer at offset 40 plus the payload at offset
48) on the belief that `rtsLaunchCpuKernel` required it: removing the front had
produced CANN `507018` on a2a3 onboard. That failure was traced to build
skew — the AICPU inner SO and AICore `.o` had not been rebuilt against the
moved offsets — not a CANN requirement. With a clean rebuild, passing the bare
`KernelArgs` (`runtime_args` @ 0, `argsSize = sizeof(KernelArgs)`) is verified
working on a2a3 onboard across HBG and TRB, so the front was removed.

### Ownership boundaries

- `LoadAicpuOp` still owns both dispatcher bootstrap registration and cached
  per-task AICPU entry launches. Splitting those into separate loader objects
  would be a larger lifecycle refactor.

## Method 3: Path B — `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_CUSTOM` (broken — #822)

The path that PR #537 attempted in order to lift Path A's latch and
allow one host process to bind both `host_build_graph` and
`tensormap_and_ringbuffer` runtimes simultaneously. Used in production
by other CANN customers; never made it to green in this repo due to a
CANN-side cache coherency bug.

### How it was supposed to work

JSON descriptor declares each inner-SO function with
`opKernelLib=AICPUKernel + userDefined=True`. CANN
(`cann/runtime/src/runtime/core/src/kernel/program_common.cc`) routes
`userDefined=True` to `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_CUSTOM (4)`. The
`aicpu_custom_scheduler` subprocess (separate from the main
`aicpu_scheduler` used by Path A) handles `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_CUSTOM`
calls.

`cann/runtime/src/aicpu_sched/aicpu_processer/ae_so_manager.cc::GetSoPath`
makes `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_CUSTOM` the **only** kernel type that looks
under `/home/CustAiCpuUser/cust_aicpu_<dev>_<vf>_<pid>/` — every other
type only searches `/usr/lib64/aicpu_kernels/...`, which is unwritable
without root. A gate at `ae_so_manager.cc:514` (`IsCustAicpuSd()`)
enforces that `KERNEL_TYPE_AICPU_CUSTOM` must execute inside the cust
subprocess; a violation aborts the load.

The latch problem is genuinely solved: `firstCreatSo_` lives in
`libaicpu_processer.so`, which the cust subprocess does not link.
Multiple inner SOs can coexist.

### How it actually fails

PR #537 reached the point where all the routing was correct: CANN
dispatched the `Dyn*` exports to the cust subprocess, the inner
`libsimpler_aicpu_<runtime>.so` was dlopen'd, all three phases
(Null / Init / Run) entered our code, and
`SchedulerContext::handshake_partition` step 1 successfully wrote
`complete=1` to all 9 cores' `Handshake` slots in HBM. **The host's D2H
readback confirmed the AICPU's writes landed in HBM**, AICore picked
them up, ran past its phase 1, and wrote its report (`aicore_done` +
`physical_core_id` + `core_type`) back into the same `Handshake` slots.

Step 2 of `handshake_partition` is then a spin-wait:

```cpp
// src/{arch}/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/runtime/scheduler/scheduler_cold_path.cpp
while (hank->aicore_done == 0) {}   // ← cust AICPU stuck here forever
```

The cust AICPU's L1 cache holds a stale `0` for `aicore_done`.
HBM has `1`, the host's D2H readback sees `1`, but the cust AICPU never
observes the change. After 2 s,
`aclrtSynchronizeStreamWithTimeout(stream_aicpu_)` reports
**`ACL_ERROR_RT_AICPU_EXCEPTION (507018)`**.

The mechanism: `cann/runtime/src/aicpu_sched/aicpu_schedule/core/aicpusd_worker.cpp::SetAffinity`
binds the cust subprocess's worker threads to `cpuId=0` (the AICPU
cluster reserved for OS-side work) rather than to the same AICPU
cluster that drives AICore. **The cust cluster's L1 is not in
AICore's HBM-write snoop domain**, so the cust AICPU never sees
AICore's writes until something explicitly invalidates the line.

Method 1 and Method 2 dodge this because they run on the main
`aicpu_scheduler` cluster, which **is** in AICore's snoop domain.

### User-space workarounds that DO NOT work

For anyone tempted to re-attempt: all four standard ARM64 cache-bypass
primitives have been tried and fail. Documenting why each one fails
saves a future session from running the same experiment.

| Attempt | Result | Why it doesn't help |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| `volatile uint32_t` field qualifier | No effect | Prevents the compiler from caching the value in a register / reusing it across statements. The CPU still reads from L1 (or whatever level holds the stale line). Cache coherency is an architectural issue below the C abstract machine. |
| `__atomic_load_n(..., __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)` (compiles to `ldar`) | No effect | `ldar` is an ordering instruction — it orders this load with respect to later loads/stores. It does **not** force a coherent reload from memory or invalidate the L1 line. |
| `dc civac` (clean + invalidate by VA to Point of Coherency) in spin loop | Worse — corrupts AICore data | The same cache line holds AICPU-written fields (`aicpu_ready`, `task`) and the AICore-written field (`aicore_done`). `civac` writes back the AICPU's dirty stale view of the line, **clobbering AICore's HBM writes** for the AICPU-owned fields. |
| `dc ivac` (invalidate-only by VA to Point of Coherency) in spin loop | Silently NOP'd | EL0 access to `dc ivac` is gated by `SCTLR_EL1.UCI`. The Linux kernel inside the cust subprocess has `UCI=0`, so the instruction traps and the kernel handler silently turns it into a NOP rather than emulating it. From userspace it looks like the instruction ran with no effect. |

The fix has to live somewhere with the privilege to either change the
memory attribute, change the affinity, or enable the EL0 cache op. All
four candidates are CANN-side or driver-side:

| # | Where | Change |
| - | ----- | ------ |
| A | CANN device kernel / driver | Set `SCTLR_EL1.UCI=1` for the cust subprocess so EL0 `dc ivac` works; user-space spin loops can then explicitly invalidate |
| B | CANN runtime / driver | Allocate handshake HBM with non-cacheable / write-through attribute when called from cust subprocess context. Small per-access HBM latency cost |
| C | CANN cust scheduler | Bind cust worker threads (`aicpusd_worker.cpp::SetAffinity`) to the same AICPU cluster as AICore's snoop domain instead of `cpuId=0` |
| D | this repo's runtime | Split `Handshake` so AICPU-written and AICore-written fields live on disjoint cache lines, then `dc civac` only the AICore-written line. Insufficient on its own because EL0 invalidate is still NOP'd — only works combined with A. Alternatively: replace the spin-wait protocol with a device event/notify primitive that bypasses shared-memory polling (substantial refactor) |

Issue #822 was closed (2026-05-20) as COMPLETED after CANN-side
mitigation landed. **The failure modes documented above remain the
durable knowledge.** If a CANN upgrade ever silently regresses one of
the A/B/C fixes, the same symptom will return; the diagnosis recipe
above stays valid.

## How to choose

- **Default to Method 2 (Path A)** for any new AICPU work in this
  repo. The reference tool at
  [`tools/cann-examples/aicpu-kernel-launch/`](../tools/cann-examples/aicpu-kernel-launch/)
  is the template
- **Use Method 1 (tar.gz)** only if you cannot avoid sudo at runtime
  and you have an existing fleet provisioning pipeline to redeploy
  through. No active use case in this repo
- **Do not reach for Method 3 (Path B)** unless you have an
  independent reason to believe at least one of CANN-side fixes A/B/C
  has shipped on your stack, AND you have a fresh end-to-end repro to
  confirm. The 507018 deadlock is silent — your test will look like a
  normal stream timeout from any other cause
