"""Multi-worker parallel tests — validates thread isolation introduced in PR 2-3.

DeviceRunner is now thread_local so each ChipWorker thread gets its own instance.
These tests verify that multiple concurrent DistWorker / Worker instances
execute correctly and in parallel without interference.

No NPU device required; SubWorker (fork/shm) is used as the execution backend.
