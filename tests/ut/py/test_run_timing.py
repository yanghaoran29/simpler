"""Tests for the RunTiming binding returned by Worker.run / run_prepared.

Pure-Python unit tests — no device, no kernels. Verifies that the nanobind
bound class behaves as documented at the boundary so callers (benchmark
scripts, perf dashboards) can rely on the contract without spinning up a
worker.
