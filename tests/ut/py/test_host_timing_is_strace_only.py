"""`[STRACE]` is the only timeline format the host emits.

Three layers, and this file pins the boundary between the first two:

- **`TIMING` is a log level** — the envelope every host record rides in.
- **`[STRACE]` is the timing system built on it**, and the only format that
  carries an *interval*. Everything a reader can place on a timeline goes
  through it, whether it was measured by an RAII scope or read back from a
  fixed-slot capture buffer and re-emitted (`STRACE_HOST_SPAN_AT`,
  `STRACE_DEV_SPAN_AT`).
- **A summed cost share is not an interval** and stays an ordinary `LOG_TIMING`
  line. Sub-operations that nest inside each other cannot honestly be drawn as
  bars, so they report a total and a count instead.

The concrete failure this prevents: the host prepare path once printed
`bind phase=<p> start_ns=<n> dur_ns=<n>` at `LOG_TIMING`, which is an interval in
a second format. It grew its own regex in `strace_timing.py`, two dedicated
tools, and a grouping heuristic that existed only because the line carried no
`pid`/`inv` — the keys a `[STRACE]` record has by construction.

A start plus a duration is the signature of that mistake, so that is what this
test looks for.
