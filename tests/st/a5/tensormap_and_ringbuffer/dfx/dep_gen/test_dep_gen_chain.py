"""dep_gen overflow chain regression — submits with >64 explicit deps.

A submit with explicit_dep_count > DEP_GEN_MAX_EXPLICIT_DEPS (=64) spills the
extra deps into one or more DepGenOverflowRecord slots that overlay the same
buffer ring. Before the chain wire format, dep_gen would silently truncate
the tail in deps.json; this test verifies every explicit dep edge survives
the round-trip writer → host collector → replay → deps.json.

Test shape (chain_barrier_orch.cpp): N producers each INOUT X, then a dummy
barrier `set_dependencies({all N producer ids})`, then a consumer
`set_dependencies({barrier_id})` reading X and writing Y. With N spanning
the {64, 65, 390, 391} boundaries we exercise:

  - n=64: base only (no chain) — sanity baseline
  - n=65: base + 1 overflow record (1 dep in overflow)
  - n=200: base + 1 overflow (136 deps in overflow)
  - n=391: base + 2 overflow (326 + 1 deps across two overflows)

Validation: the barrier task in deps.json must have exactly N predecessors,
all of which are the producer ids. The consumer must have one explicit
predecessor — the barrier.
