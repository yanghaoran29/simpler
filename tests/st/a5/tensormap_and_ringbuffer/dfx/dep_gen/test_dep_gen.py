"""dep_gen capture + replay sim test.

Re-runs the ``vector_example`` orchestration with ``--enable-dep-gen``.
Verifies the end-to-end dep_gen pipeline on a5sim:

  ``<output_prefix>/deps.json`` is produced by the host replay
  (PTO2TensorMap replay → JSON edge list), and contains exactly the
  6 edges documented in example_orchestration.cpp. The capture path
  (host collector drains the device ring buffer into memory and feeds
  the replay directly — no submit_trace.bin on disk) is exercised
  implicitly: if it broke, deps.json would be empty or wrong.

deps.json is now the sole source of truth for fanout edges — the device
hot path no longer records L2SwimlaneAicpuTaskRecord::fanout[], so there is no
"fanout ⊆ deps" cross-check to run. swimlane_converter.py joins
deps.json into the Perfetto trace at post-process time.

Compute correctness is delegated to the upstream ``vector_example`` test —
this case re-uses the same orchestration to keep coverage focused on the
capture+replay+validation pipeline.
