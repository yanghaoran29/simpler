"""Regression test for batch dispatch OOB (issue #565).

Submits two back-to-back MIX tasks each with block_num=48 (>> 24 clusters).
When both tasks enter the ready queue simultaneously, pop_ready_tasks_batch
returns got=2.  Without the fix, the first task's do-while drains all idle
clusters, and the second task's do-while calls pop_first() on an empty mask,
returning -1 as cluster_offset — an out-of-bounds array index.

Each block writes float(block_idx) at 3 cache lines (AIC, AIV0, AIV1).
Output tensor: 2 * 48 * 3 = 288 cache lines = 4608 float32.
