"""SPMD sync_start AIV: 4 AIV tasks testing fast path and drain. Output: 48 CL = 768 float32.

The cohort widths are fractions of the run's core count, derived on device and
reported back in `layout` — a run always takes the whole device, and that width
differs between sim and silicon. The golden is rebuilt from the reported
geometry; `output` is sized for the widest device the platform allows.
