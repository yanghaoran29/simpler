"""dep_gen host-direct capture test for host_build_graph.

Runs the same ``vector_example`` orchestration the tensormap_and_ringbuffer
dep_gen test uses, with ``--enable-dep-gen``, and asserts the same 6 edges come
out. host_build_graph orchestrates on the host, so its graph is captured from
the orchestrator's own dependency path rather than replayed from a device ring —
sharing the orchestration with the device-orch test is what makes the two
answers comparable, and this test is where a divergence would surface.

Compute correctness is delegated to the upstream ``vector_example`` tests; this
case re-uses the orchestration purely to keep coverage on the capture pipeline.
