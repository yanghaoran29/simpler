"""available_aicore_counts: the runtime's core counts are real and spendable.

The orchestration reports what `rt_available_*_count()` gave it in `shape` and
spends it: a MIX cohort of exactly `cluster_count` blocks, each writing its
block index into `blocks`.

An **over**-reported count fails: the cohort asks for `require_sync_start`,
so it needs every block co-resident and the deadlock guard fires on device.

An **under**-reported count is NOT detected. Catching one needs an expectation
the host holds independently of what the device said, and the only such handle
was a pinned `block_dim` — a knob that no longer exists now that a run always
takes the whole device. Everything here derives from the reported number, so a
count that is too small is self-consistent: fewer blocks launch, fewer slots are
expected, and the tail is zero on both sides.

host_build_graph is where the counts are hardest to get right: its
orchestrator runs on the host, inside the bind, so it reads `worker_count`
off `Runtime` rather than the AICPU's handshake result. Publishing the core
geometry any later than that hands host orchestration a zero, which the Pinned
case catches (0 != 4) while leaving the `require_sync_start` guard it feeds
silently disabled.
