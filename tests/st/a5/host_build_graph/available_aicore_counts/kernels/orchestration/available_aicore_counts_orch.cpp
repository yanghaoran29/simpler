/**
 * available_aicore_counts: spend the counts rt_available_*_count() reports.
 *
 * The counts are an AICPU-side runtime query with no host-side equivalent, so
 * the run is made self-describing rather than compared against a pinned number:
 * `shape` carries the reported cluster / AIV counts, and a MIX cohort of
 * exactly `cluster_count` blocks writes its block index into `blocks`. The host
 * reads the width out of `shape` and checks that many block slots.
 *
 * require_sync_start on the cohort is what makes the count falsifiable: the
 * cohort needs every block co-resident, so an over-reported cluster count trips
 * the sync-start deadlock guard instead of silently passing.
