"""A host_build_graph run emits its own graph even when another thread drains it.

host_build_graph captures the dependency graph while the orchestrator runs on the
host, inside ``submit`` (bind), and the graph lives in state private to the thread
that ran it. Emitting it at the end of that same bind is what keeps the write on
the capturing thread; emitting at drain instead would not, because the run lane
serializes with a mutex — mutual exclusion, not thread affinity.

This drives the shape that separates the two: ``submit`` at depth one blocks the
second submission and drains its predecessor before admitting itself, so a second
thread's submit is what reaps the first thread's run. With the write at drain the
first run's ``deps.json`` was never produced — emit reported "no capture on this
thread" (-3) and returned.

Both submissions are ordinary public API on one Worker: ``submit`` returns without
waiting and admits concurrent callers through an operation lease, so nothing here
reaches past the supported surface.
