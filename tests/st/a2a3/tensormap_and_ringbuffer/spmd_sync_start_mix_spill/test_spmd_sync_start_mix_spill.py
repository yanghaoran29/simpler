"""sync_start MIX per-core pending-spill: a flagged AIV producer occupies all 48 AIV cores (and
spins), leaving the 24 AIC cores idle. The require_sync_start MIX consumer then pre-stages with
EVERY cluster mixed — AIC on an idle running slot, both AIVs on the producer's busy cores' gated
pending slots. Exercises the rendezvous seed/mask counting on the MIX per-core split path
(drain_stage_cores to_pending=true, mix_cluster_idle_core_count=1/cluster + Case 3.3 promote for
the 48 pending AIVs). A counting mismatch stalls the rendezvous -> gated cores never launch ->
allocator deadlock.

The producer spans every AIV core and the consumer every cluster, so both
widths are the device's own counts — a run always takes the whole device, and
that width differs between sim and silicon. The orchestration reports the two
widths in `layout` and the golden is rebuilt from them.
