"""predicated_dispatch: a dispatch predicate is evaluated by the scheduler at the
dispatch point (delayed evaluation), not in orchestration.

The predicate value is produced by a prior task; the scheduler reads it only
when the predicated task becomes ready (its producer done), so orchestration
never stalls on it. Chain:

  gate_producer writes gate[0] = gate_value (INT32)
  x_producer    writes X[0]   = 42.0
  clobber       would write X[0] = 999.0, but carries set_predicate(gate[0] > 0)
                and depends on gate_producer; the scheduler reads gate[0] at the
                dispatch point and dispatches only if gate[0] > 0.
  consumer      copies X[0] -> Y[0]

  case=1 (gate_value = 0): predicate FALSE -> clobber NOT dispatched -> X stays
         42.0 -> Y = 42.0. Proves non-dispatch AND that the retired task still
         unlocks the consumer.
  case=2 (gate_value = 1): predicate TRUE -> clobber dispatched -> X = 999.0 ->
         Y = 999.0. Proves the dispatch path is taken when the predicate holds.
