"""Several diagnostic runs on one worker, each with its own output prefix.

The collectors are resident: their device resources and threads are created on
the first run that needs them and released at ``finalize_device``. Everything
that describes a single run therefore has to be reset between runs, and nothing
in the framework exercises that — ``--rounds > 1`` disables every diagnostic
channel (``effective_diagnostic_options``), so "one worker, several runs, DFX
on" does not otherwise occur in the test suite.

Two distinct failures are covered, both silent — they produce *wrong artifacts*
rather than an error:

* **Leaked per-run state.** A record vector or device counter carried over makes
  a run's artifact describe an earlier one. For ``deps.json`` a leaked device
  counter makes ``reconcile_counters`` compare one run's collected count against
  a device total accumulated over both, which suppresses the export entirely.
  For the swimlane the observed shape is subtler than duplication: the merge of
  the collector shards is latched by a "already merged" flag, so a second run
  re-exports the *first run's records verbatim* — same count, same everything.
  A count or non-emptiness check therefore cannot see it, and neither can
  comparing the two runs' payloads, which are identical by construction. What
  separates them is time: the runs are sequential, so their record windows
  cannot overlap, and a re-export of stale records lands in the earlier window.

* **A latched pool shape.** Collector pools are seeded for the core and
  AICPU-thread counts of the run that built them, and a core's recycled lane is
  assigned modulo the thread count. A run with different counts must rebuild
  them, so the last run here asks for a different ``aicpu_thread_num`` and must
  still produce a complete artifact.

Scope, stated plainly: this catches dep_gen and the swimlane export. The other
three channels (pmu, args_dump, scope_stats) reconcile with a WARN and export
anyway, so a leaked counter there does not change their artifacts and this test
would not see it — their resets rest on being structurally identical to the two
that are covered. Asserting on the reconcile warnings is not an option: they are
emitted by the C++ HostLogger, which does not route through Python's logging, so
a ``caplog`` assertion silently matches nothing (measured, not assumed).

The collectors are shared code, so one arch covers them. It is a2a3 because that
is the arch with a host-map path: a resident collector that leaks a
halHostRegister mapping across runs fails the next one at rc=8, and only the
onboard a2a3 lane can observe it.
