"""Shared chip_swimlane post-case validation.

The vector_example and paged_attention swimlane tests run the same capture →
tool smoke → differential gate sequence; the only difference between them is
the workload itself. The helpers below are workload-agnostic so each test
file owns only its CALLABLE + cases.

The differential gate is the load-bearing assertion: it parses the script's
printed Pop / Fanout / Fanin totals and cross-checks them against an oracle
computed straight from the raw artifacts. The paged_attention test exercises
the per-task dedup branch in ``compute_dag_stats_from_deps`` because mixed
AIC+AIV tasks produce multiple perf rows per ``task_id``.
