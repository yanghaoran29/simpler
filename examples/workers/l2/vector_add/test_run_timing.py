"""Hardware ST asserting Worker.run returns a usable RunTiming.

Reuses the vector_add example's kernel + ChipCallable build so this test
doesn't drag in its own kernel sources. The contract being verified:

    * `worker.run(...)` returns a `RunTiming` instance (not None).
    * `host_wall_us` is strictly positive — there's no way a real dispatch
      took zero steady-clock time, so this would catch a regression where
      the C ABI stopped writing the timing back to the out-param.
    * `device_wall_us` is strictly positive on the default build, even
      without `--enable-l2-swimlane`. The orch_summary write was decoupled
      from the swimlane shared-region path so device timing is always
      available when PTO2_PROFILING is compiled in (default).
    * `host_wall_us > device_wall_us` — host wall must wrap the device
      dispatch, so the host clock should always read longer.
