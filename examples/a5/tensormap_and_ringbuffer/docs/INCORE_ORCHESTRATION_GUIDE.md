# InCore Orchestration Guide: tensormap_and_ringbuffer

## Goal

In tensormap_and_ringbuffer, the orchestration function runs on AICPU and builds the graph directly on device. Dependencies are discovered automatically by TensorMap based on tensor overlap, and task memory is allocated from ring buffers.

## Where To Put Orchestration Code

- Each example keeps orchestration sources under `examples/a5/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/<example>/kernels/orchestration/`.
- `examples/a5/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/<example>/kernels/kernel_config.py` selects the orchestration source and the runtime `tensormap_and_ringbuffer`.

## Required Exports

Your orchestration shared object must export:

```cpp
extern "C" PTO2OrchestrationConfig aicpu_orchestration_config(const L2TaskArgs &orch_args);
extern "C" void aicpu_orchestration_entry(const L2TaskArgs &orch_args);
```

Both symbols are loaded by AICPU via `dlopen` in `src/a5/runtime/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/aicpu/aicpu_executor.cpp`.

## Argument Layout

Arguments are constructed by `SceneTestCase` (via `TaskArgsBuilder`, see `simpler_setup/scene_test.py`) and passed through host init into `Runtime::orch_args` as device pointers or scalars. For the default `TENSOR_ORDER` flow, the layout is:

```text
[ptr_0, ptr_1, ..., ptr_n, nbytes_0, nbytes_1, ..., nbytes_n, element_count]
```

Validate `arg_count` in `aicpu_orchestration_config` and interpret pointers as device addresses.

## Building The Graph

1. Wrap orchestration in scopes with `PTO2_SCOPE()` to control tensor lifetimes.
2. Use `make_tensor_external` for existing device buffers and `TensorCreateInfo` + `add_output(...)` for runtime-created intermediates.
3. Use `add_inout(...)` for existing tensors that a kernel writes.
4. Build `L0TaskArgs` with `add_input`, `add_output`, `add_inout` for tensors and `add_scalar` for scalars.
   > **Constraint**: All tensor parameters (`add_input` / `add_output` / `add_inout`) **must** be added before any scalar parameters (`add_scalar` / `add_scalars`). Violating this order will trigger an assertion failure. This is because the runtime dispatches tensor arguments first in kernel args, followed by scalars, and the layout must match.

   ```cpp
   // Correct
   L0TaskArgs p;
   p.add_input(a);
   p.add_inout(b);
   p.add_scalar(val);    // scalars after all tensors

   // Wrong — triggers assertion
   L0TaskArgs p;
   p.add_scalar(val);    // scalar added too early
   p.add_input(a);       // assertion: "scalar must add after all tensor added"
   ```

5. Submit tasks with one of:
   - `rt_submit_aic_task(kernel_id, args)` — AIC (CUBE) task
   - `rt_submit_aiv_task(kernel_id, args)` — AIV (VECTOR) task
   - `rt_submit_task(mixed_kernels, args)` — mixed task with a `MixedKernels` struct

Dependencies are inferred by TensorMap from input/inout/output tensors, so you do not add explicit edges.

## Submit API And Kernel IDs

- Submit helpers are defined in `pto_orchestration_api.h`.
- `rt_submit_aic_task` and `rt_submit_aiv_task` are convenience wrappers around `rt_submit_task` with a `MixedKernels` struct.
- For mixed AIC+AIV tasks, construct a `MixedKernels` struct directly:

  ```cpp
  MixedKernels mk;
  mk.aic_kernel_id = FUNC_QK;
  mk.aiv0_kernel_id = FUNC_SF;
  rt_submit_task(mk, args);
  ```

- Kernel `func_id` values are defined in `kernels/kernel_config.py` under `KERNELS`.

## Completion Semantics

Do not call `rt_orchestration_done` yourself in device mode. The executor wraps the entry call in an outer scope and signals completion after `aicpu_orchestration_entry` returns.

## Examples

- `examples/a5/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/vector_example/kernels/orchestration/example_orchestration.cpp` (AIV-only tasks)
- `examples/a5/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/bgemm/kernels/orchestration/bgemm_orch.cpp` (mixed AIC + AIV tasks)
