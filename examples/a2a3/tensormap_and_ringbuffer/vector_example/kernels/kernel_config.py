Tensormap and Ringbuffer Kernel and Orchestration Configuration

Defines the kernels and orchestration function used by the tensormap_and_ringbuffer example.
Supports both hardware (a2a3) and simulation (a2a3sim) platforms.

This runtime uses device-side orchestration (AICPU thread 3), so the orchestration
function is compiled into the AICPU binary rather than loaded as a separate SO.
