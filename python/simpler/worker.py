"""Worker — unified factory for all hierarchy levels.

Callable identity is exposed as an opaque ``CallableHandle`` returned by
``Worker.register(callable)``. L2 ``Worker.run`` and hierarchical
``Orchestrator.submit_next_level`` / ``submit_sub`` consume handles, never raw
``ChipCallable`` objects. L3+ ``Worker.run`` keeps the existing raw Python
orchestration-function entry point; that function captures handles and submits
them through the Orchestrator. L≥3 targets resolve the handle's stable SHA-256
digest to a private L2-side slot; later Python registrations are serialized
and sent through the mailbox control plane.

Usage::

    # L2: one NPU chip
    w = Worker(level=2, device_id=8, platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
    w.init()
    chip_handle = w.register(chip_callable)                 # L2 may register pre or post init()
    w.run(chip_handle, chip_args, config)
    w.close()

    # L3: multiple chips + SubWorkers, auto-discovery in init()
    w = Worker(level=3, device_ids=[8, 9], num_sub_workers=2,
               platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
    chip_handle = w.register(chip_callable)                 # ChipCallable, before init()
    sub_handle  = w.register(lambda args: postprocess())    # Python sub, before init()
    w.init()

    def my_orch(orch, args, cfg):
        r = orch.submit_next_level(chip_handle, chip_args_ptr, cfg, worker=0)
        orch.submit_sub(sub_handle, sub_args)

    w.run(my_orch, my_args, my_config)
    w.close()

    # L4: recursive composition — L3 Workers as children
    l3 = Worker(level=3, device_ids=[8, 9], num_sub_workers=1,
                platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
    w4 = Worker(level=4, num_sub_workers=1)
    l3_handle = w4.register(my_l3_orch)
    verify_handle = w4.register(lambda args: verify())
    l3_worker_id = w4.add_worker(l3)
    w4.init()

    def my_l4_orch(orch, args, config):
        orch.submit_next_level(l3_handle, chip_args, config, worker=l3_worker_id)
        orch.submit_sub(verify_handle)

    w4.run(my_l4_orch)

    Sole waiter on a child mailbox: sub workers, nested next-level workers and

    in what they do with a task and which control sub-commands they accept.

    `handle_task(task_buf)` and `handle_control(sub_cmd)` each return an

    mailbox error region *before* the DONE state, so the parent never observes
    completion without the matching error report.

    `on_shutdown()` runs on SHUTDOWN before the loop exits, for children that
    own a nested Worker; per-child resource teardown that must survive an
    exception belongs in the caller's own ``finally``.

    A parent that dies without sending SHUTDOWN (SIGKILL from a timeout, an OOM
    kill, a cancelled CI job) would otherwise leave this loop polling a mailbox
    nobody writes to, for the lifetime of the machine. The loop therefore
    samples its own parent and leaves by the SHUTDOWN path once it changes.

        """Tear down the whole forked subtree + shms after a bootstrap failure.

        Called from the init() failure path — the single rollback entry
        (_cleanup_partial_init) — so `dw.init()` may or may not have run.

        ``deadline`` is one absolute ``time.monotonic()`` budget shared by both
        phases (cooperative wait and the final reap), so the whole rollback is
        bounded end-to-end; a survivor still alive at the deadline is left to the
        OS/init rather than blocking this thread on a D-state child. Defaults to
        one ``_ROLLBACK_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT_S`` window.

        Teardown proceeds in two bounded phases within one cleanup budget:

        1. Cooperative. A child that reached its serve loop (READY) is asked to
           close gracefully via SHUTDOWN so it finalizes its device / unlinks its
           own nested shms. A next-level child still inside ``inner.init()``
           (mid-init, and possibly already the parent of grandchildren) is sent
           SIGTERM, which unwinds its ``inner.init()`` and recursively reclaims
           its grandchildren and their nested shms.
        2. Hard backstop. Any child still alive past the cleanup deadline is
           reaped. As the startup root, ``killpg`` takes the whole subtree — the
           child and every descendant that inherited its process group — so a
           mid-init grandchild is reaped here rather than left to the
           multiprocessing resource_tracker; a nested (non-root) worker SIGKILLs
           the direct pid and relies on the root's killpg. PIDs the barrier
           already reaped are excluded so a reused PID is never signalled.

        drop its own cached import for the identity.

        Rejects outright if any currently in-flight L3+ run (not yet past ``_cleanup_published``)
        sent this identity as a NEXT_LEVEL or SUB Tensor arg, or any in-flight L2 direct-chip run
        sent it — a Buffer never goes away while a dispatched task still names it. All three
        dispatch paths retain: a SUB task maps the identity into a sub-worker process just as a
        NEXT_LEVEL task maps it into a child, so unlinking the backing under either one faults the
        consumer on a segment that no longer has a name.

        The L3+ check takes ``_submit_mu`` first: a handle is visible in ``_accepted_run_handles``
        before its orchestration callback (where ``touched_identities`` gets populated) has run, and
        that callback is what ``_submit_mu`` already serializes graph construction against, so taking
        it here means the check only ever runs between callbacks, never mid-callback with a
        not-yet-complete touched set. ``_abandoned_run_handles`` is scanned in the same block and
        without the ``_cleanup_published`` test: ``_publish_abandoned_run`` sets that flag and drops
        the handle from the accepted set while the run itself stays retained until native teardown
        drains it, so an abandoned run is exactly the case where the flag stops describing whether
        the device is done with the backing. Such a buffer therefore stops being releasable through
        this API for the Worker's remaining life, which strands nothing: ``close()`` reclaims it via
        ``_release_all_buffers`` calling ``Buffer.close()`` directly.

        The L2 check is independent (a separate run-id namespace with no callback to serialize
        against — ``_chip_run_touched_identities`` is written atomically alongside ``_chip_runs``
        under ``_registry_lock`` instead, see ``_submit_l2_locked``), so the two checks run
        sequentially rather than under one shared lock. Neither is checked once ``buffer`` is already
        closed, matching ``Buffer.close()``'s own idempotency.

        The entry survives a failed close, so ``_release_all_buffers`` still reports the leak at
        close() rather than losing it here — the import-cache broadcast only fires once close() has
        actually succeeded, so a failed release never tells a descendant to drop a mapping the owner
        still considers live. The converse does not hold, and is the one asymmetry here: a
        ``Buffer.close()`` whose ``shm.close()`` raises has still unlinked the name (its ``finally``
        runs the unlink), so the backing can be nameless while descendants keep mappings this call
        never told them to drop. A descendant materializing that identity afterwards gets the named
        ``FileNotFoundError`` from ``ImportRegistry.materialize``, not a silent bad mapping.

        The slot is dropped only when it still holds *this* buffer: a buffer_id minted elsewhere can
        collide with a registry key, and evicting the live entry it names would strand that
        backing."""

        A permanent commitment, not a reversible attempt: CLOSED is published

        rejected from then on. Put the call in a ``finally`` — a worker that is
        never closed keeps its device held.

        - Reentrant ``close()`` from inside a leased operation is rejected.
        - ``close()`` during an in-progress ``init()`` on another thread
          cooperatively cancels it: the init epoch unwinds and this call
          proceeds to teardown. Cancellation is observed only at cooperative
          points, so an init blocked inside a native segment is not
          interrupted — this call raises after
          ``_CLOSE_CANCEL_UNWIND_TIMEOUT_S`` rather than blocking forever.
          Closing from the init-owner thread itself is rejected.
        - A concurrent ``close()`` joins the in-flight attempt and observes its
          result; teardown never runs twice at once.
        - A later ``close()`` retries journaled teardown debt. The journal keeps
          each resource until its native free succeeds and preserves the child
          pid/mailbox pair until ``waitpid`` proves the child is gone.
        - Native teardown runs on the ``init()``-owner thread, being device-bound.
