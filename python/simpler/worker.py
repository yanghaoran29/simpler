"""Worker — unified factory for all hierarchy levels.

Callable identity is exposed as an opaque ``CallableHandle`` returned by
``Worker.register(callable)``. L2 ``Worker.run`` and hierarchical
``Orchestrator.submit_next_level`` / ``submit_sub`` consume handles, never raw
``ChipCallable`` objects. L3+ ``Worker.run`` keeps the existing raw Python
orchestration-function entry point; that function captures handles and submits
them through the Orchestrator. L≥3 targets resolve the handle's stable SHA-256
digest to a private L2-side slot; later Python registrations are serialized
and sent through the mailbox control plane.

Usage::

    # L2: one NPU chip
    w = Worker(level=2, device_id=8, platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
    w.init()
    chip_handle = w.register(chip_callable)                 # L2 may register pre or post init()
    w.run(chip_handle, chip_args, config)
    w.close()

    # L3: multiple chips + SubWorkers, auto-discovery in init()
    w = Worker(level=3, device_ids=[8, 9], num_sub_workers=2,
               platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
    chip_handle = w.register(chip_callable)                 # ChipCallable, before init()
    sub_handle  = w.register(lambda args: postprocess())    # Python sub, before init()
    w.init()

    def my_orch(orch, args, cfg):
        r = orch.submit_next_level(chip_handle, chip_args_ptr, cfg)
        orch.submit_sub(sub_handle, sub_args)

    w.run(my_orch, my_args, my_config)
    w.close()

    # L4: recursive composition — L3 Workers as children
    l3 = Worker(level=3, device_ids=[8, 9], num_sub_workers=1,
                platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer")
    w4 = Worker(level=4, num_sub_workers=1)
    l3_handle = w4.register(my_l3_orch)

        """Tear down the whole forked subtree + shms after a bootstrap failure.

        Called from the init() failure path — the single rollback entry
        (_cleanup_partial_init) — so `dw.init()` may or may not have run.

        ``deadline`` is one absolute ``time.monotonic()`` budget shared by both
        phases (cooperative wait and the final reap), so the whole rollback is
        bounded end-to-end; a survivor still alive at the deadline is left to the
        OS/init rather than blocking this thread on a D-state child. Defaults to
        one ``_ROLLBACK_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT_S`` window.

        Teardown proceeds in two bounded phases within one cleanup budget:

        1. Cooperative. A child that reached its serve loop (READY) is asked to
           close gracefully via SHUTDOWN so it finalizes its device / unlinks its
           own nested shms. A next-level child still inside ``inner.init()``
           (mid-init, and possibly already the parent of grandchildren) is sent
           SIGTERM, which unwinds its ``inner.init()`` and recursively reclaims
           its grandchildren and their nested shms.
        2. Hard backstop. Any child still alive past the cleanup deadline is
           reaped. As the startup root, ``killpg`` takes the whole subtree — the
           child and every descendant that inherited its process group — so a
           mid-init grandchild is reaped here rather than left to the
           multiprocessing resource_tracker; a nested (non-root) worker SIGKILLs
           the direct pid and relies on the root's killpg. PIDs the barrier
           already reaped are excluded so a reused PID is never signalled.
