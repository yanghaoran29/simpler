"""Simpler runtime — public Python surface.

Host-side log filter setup happens during worker initialization. A hierarchical
`Worker` seeds the parent before its first fork; `ChipWorker.init` (see
`simpler.task_interface`) repeats that initialization in each child before the
C++ `_ChipWorker.init` loads runtime modules. The native extension owns the
shared state; each host module contains its own logger implementation and binds
to that state immediately after it is loaded. Onboard `simpler_init` also maps
the threshold onto CANN's coarser dlog ladder.

`Worker` and the `task_interface` and `trace` submodules resolve on first
attribute access rather than at import time: they pull in the `_task_interface`
extension, so eager imports here would make `import simpler` fail wherever that
extension is missing or stale, including for callers that only want the logging
helpers.
