"""Per-phase statistics from the `chip.run.bind.*` spans of a host_build_graph run.

Reads the log a `SIMPLER_HBG_BIND_BREAKDOWN_ENABLE=1 --rounds N` run leaves
behind and reports each bind segment's minimum, median and maximum across the
warm binds, plus the control-plane total.

The spread is the point: a change smaller than the range beside it cannot be
demonstrated. `strace_timing --tree` gives the median alone, and its default
table a mean, so neither answers "is this difference real".

What the phases are, and how to compare two runs:
