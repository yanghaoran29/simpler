"""Scheduler overhead analysis — is the scheduler the bottleneck, or starved?

Inputs (BOTH required, captured in SEPARATE runs — do not co-run the flags, as
dep_gen perturbs the swimlane timing):
  1. Per-task perf profiling data (chip_swimlane_records_*.json) from a
     ``--enable-chip-swimlane`` level >= 2 run. Level >= 3 additionally supplies
     ``scheduler_records`` for the producer-specific phase breakdown.
  2. deps.json (the task DAG) from a separate ``--enable-dep-gen`` run. It drives
     ready(C) = max(producer.end), which separates scheduler bubbles from
     dependency stalls. Required — the report errors without it.

Report (see docs/dfx/sched-overhead-model.md for the model):
  Part 1 Overhead verdict (per-engine + system all/has overhead, % of makespan) |
  Part 2 aicore switch (per-core pickup totals + makespan bound) |
  Part 3/4 Head/Tail OH distributions | Part 5 scheduler phase budget |
  Part 6 critical-path attribution.

Usage:
    python -m simpler_setup.tools.sched_overhead_analysis \\
        --chip-swimlane-records-json <swimlane.json> --deps-json <deps.json>

    derived from deps.json edges + per-task scheduling-thread attribution.

    Why this lives in Python and not the runtime: the DAG edge set is already
    captured structurally by dep_gen (deps.json), and the per-task → scheduler-
    thread map is in ``chip_swimlane_records.json::core_to_thread``. Re-instrumenting
    the AICPU to track fanout edge counts is duplicate work; running this in
    Python over the existing artifacts is cheaper, more accurate (deps.json
    captures #599 race-window edges that fanout[] dropped), and lets the
    analysis work on default builds that don't have SIMPLER_SCHED_PROFILING=1.

    Edge dedup: deps.json may carry multiple records for the same (pred, succ)
    pair (different ``source``: explicit / creator / tensormap). The runtime
    fanin builder dedups to a single edge per pair, so this function projects
    onto unique (pred, succ) before counting — yields a count that matches the
    runtime's view, not the structural superset.

    Per-thread attribution: each completed task has a ``core_id``; the JSON's
    top-level ``core_to_thread`` maps that to a scheduler thread index. fanout
    work for task T is billed to the thread that retired T (where on_mixed_
    task_complete walks T's fanout list). fanin work for the consumers it makes
    ready is tightly coupled in time and billed to the same thread.

    Mutates ``threads`` dict so existing report code that reads
    ``t["fanout_edges"]`` / ``["fanout_max_degree"]`` / ``["fanin_edges"]`` /
    ``["fanin_max_degree"]`` works unchanged.
