# Tools shipped in the wheel

End-user CLIs for preparing scene tests and analyzing profiling data or args dumps.
All are invokable as Python modules once the `simpler` wheel is installed —
no repo checkout required.

> Dev-only scripts (`benchmark_rounds.sh`, `verify_packaging.sh`) live in the
> repo-level [`tools/`](../../tools/) directory and are **not** shipped.

## Tool list

- **[scene_test_compile](#scene_test_compile)** — collect and compile selected Scene Test callables without an NPU
- **[swimlane_converter](#swimlane_converter)** — perf JSON → Chrome Trace Event (Perfetto)
- **[sched_overhead_analysis](#sched_overhead_analysis)** — scheduler overhead / Tail OH breakdown
- **[critical_path](#critical_path)** — chip swimlane critical-path compute/stall analysis
- **[strace_timing](#strace_timing)** — per-stage `chip.run` breakdown (host + AICPU phases) from `[STRACE]` log markers → TPOT table, per-round table (`--rounds-table`), nested tree (`--tree`), or Perfetto JSON
- **[hbg_bind_phases](#hbg_bind_phases)** — `host_build_graph` `bind`-stage segments from the `chip.run.bind.*` spans → per-segment min/median/max plus the control-plane total
- **[phase_time_split](#phase_time_split)** — the same segment spans split into on-CPU and off-CPU per segment, from per-thread CPU clocks, with cold and warm binds reported separately
- **[dump_viewer](#dump_viewer)** — inspect / export args dumps (see [docs/args-dump.md](../../docs/dfx/args-dump.md) for full workflow)
- **[deps_viewer](#deps_viewer)** — `deps.json` (dep_gen) → text or pan/zoom HTML dependency graph
- **[wait_reduction_sim](#wait_reduction_sim)** — `deps.json` (dep_gen) → bounded-bitmap WAIT reduction coverage vs the full-DAG upper bound, per BL

For CLIs that allow an omitted input, auto-detection paths
(`outputs/*/chip_swimlane_records.json`, `outputs/*/args_dump/`) are resolved
relative to the **current working directory** — run these from the directory
that holds your `outputs/`. Each test case writes into its own
`outputs/<case>_<ts>/` directory; those tools auto-pick the latest by mtime.

---

## scene_test_compile

Populate the persistent Scene Test kernel cache without creating a `Worker` or
accessing an NPU. Arguments after the module name are passed to pytest
collection, so the warm-up can use the same paths and selection filters as the
later device run.

```bash
python -m simpler_setup.tools.scene_test_compile examples tests/st \
    -m "not sdma" --platform a2a3 --require-pto-isa --compile-workers 8
```

Compiled `ChipCallable` blobs are stored under `build/cache/kernels/`, with
independent incore artifacts under `build/cache/kernels/incore/`. A normal
pytest or standalone scene-test run first loads a matching callable blob. On a
callable miss, unchanged incore artifacts are reused and only missing kernels
are compiled before assembly. Source, transitive-include, compiler,
compilation-logic, or compiler-visible path changes produce the corresponding
new content key. The compiler runs from the checkout root, so checkout-local
paths are stable relative paths: path-sensitive macros remain correct and cache
entries can move between CI runners. Paths outside the checkout remain absolute.
Entries unused for 14 days are pruned. Cache misses compile with an automatic
process-wide budget: two logical CPUs remain available to pytest/Python and at
most eight compiler processes run across all test classes and callable artifacts.
`--compile-workers N` overrides that budget. Class-level and per-callable
parallelism share it, so their worker counts never multiply into additional
compiler processes in one process. A class that fails to compile is reported
without aborting the rest of the pass. The warm-up does not inspect or access
NPU devices.

---

## critical_path

Post-processing analysis over an chip-swimlane run. Given a run directory, it
recursively discovers every directory containing all three required artifacts:

- `chip_swimlane_records.json` (or legacy `l2_perf_records.json`)
- `deps.json`
- `name_map*.json` (the newest matching sibling is used when several exist)

When a sibling `merged_swimlane*.json` is present, the newest matching file is
used as the source for two additional Perfetto-compatible traces:

- `CPM_static.json` — highlights the Static CPM task set.
- `CPM_observed.json` — highlights the Observed path task set.

Both files retain every view, metadata event, bar, and flow from the merged
trace. Only AIC/AIV task bars in Worker View (`pid=4`) outside the selected path
are renamed to `·(rXtY)` (or `·(tY)` for ring 0); path bars and every slice
in other views keep their original names. With Perfetto's default name-based
coloring, the middle dot maps to a light blue-purple while digits are removed
before hashing, so anonymous Worker View bars share a subdued color and path
bars remain grouped by function. `dummy(...)` and `alloc(...)` bars keep their
original names because the AICore critical-path model does not classify them.

This supports both simpler directories such as `outputs/<case>_<ts>/` and
PyPTO directories such as `build_output/<case>/dfx_outputs/`, including nested
rank/device layouts. Each discovered artifact directory is analyzed separately,
and its `critical_path_report.md` is written beside
`chip_swimlane_records.json`. Pointing the command at a whole run therefore
creates one local report per rank/device rather than one combined report at the
scan root.

For each rank/device, the tool builds a happens-before DAG from the dependency
graph oriented by observed timestamps, then computes two critical paths:

- **Static CPM** — the longest duration-weighted path, i.e. the
  dependency-limited latency floor with unlimited cores.
- **Observed** — the as-executed backward blame walk from the last-finishing
  task. Each task's compute plus its preceding scheduling stall (`data-wait`,
  `core-wait`, or `front-gap`) tiles the makespan exactly.

The report contains a makespan/CPM/compute/stall overview, a per-kernel-family
table, and a full per-task listing. It is pure post-processing: no C++ or device
is required. If no sibling `merged_swimlane*.json` exists, Markdown analysis
still succeeds and the tool prints a warning that the two Perfetto traces were
skipped.

```bash
# Analyze one simpler output directory or an entire PyPTO run tree
python -m simpler_setup.tools.critical_path outputs/<case>_<ts>
python -m simpler_setup.tools.critical_path build_output/<case>

# Customize each local report filename/table size and print a combined stdout view
python -m simpler_setup.tools.critical_path <run-dir> \
    --report critical_path_report.md --top 25 --stdout
```

`--report` accepts a filename, not a path, so the report cannot be redirected
away from the directory containing its source `chip_swimlane_records.json`.

---

## swimlane_converter

Convert performance profiling JSON files into Chrome Trace Event format for visualization in Perfetto.

### Overview

Converts simpler profiling data (`chip_swimlane_records_*.json`) into the format used by the Perfetto trace viewer (<https://ui.perfetto.dev/>) and prints a per-function task-execution summary. With `--overhead` (needs `deps.json`) it also adds an **Overhead Analysis** counter group under the AICPU Scheduler track — 8 lines (`oh_{aic,aiv}_{idle,ready,overhead}` + `oh_all_overhead` / `oh_has_overhead`) you can overlay on the task bars. See [docs/dfx/sched-overhead-model.md](../../docs/dfx/sched-overhead-model.md) for the model.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Auto-detect the latest profiling file under ./outputs/
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter

# Specify an input file
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/chip_swimlane_records.json

# A unique sibling name_map*.json is loaded automatically.
# Override it explicitly when needed:
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/chip_swimlane_records.json \
    --func-names outputs/<case>_<ts>/name_map_<case>.json

# Specify an output file
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/chip_swimlane_records.json -o custom_output.json

# Load function name mapping from kernel_config.py
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/chip_swimlane_records.json \
    -k examples/host_build_graph/paged_attention/kernels/kernel_config.py

# Verbose mode (for debugging)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/chip_swimlane_records.json -v

# Reuse a deps.json captured in an earlier dep_gen run (different output dir)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter outputs/<case>_<ts>/chip_swimlane_records.json \
    --deps-json outputs/<case>_<earlier_ts>/deps.json

# Merge one same-host L3 dispatch laid out as rankN/d0/chip_swimlane_records.json
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter build_output/<case>/dfx_outputs \
    --dispatch d0 -o build_output/<case>/dfx_outputs/l3_swimlane.json

# Merge one parent group dispatch even when its members use different dN paths
python -m simpler_setup.tools.swimlane_converter build_output/<case>/dfx_outputs \
    --dispatch-id 17:5 -o build_output/<case>/dfx_outputs/l3_swimlane.json
```

Directory mode requires level-4 captures with successful Host/Device clock
anchors and the same non-empty `metadata.host_clock_domain_id`. New captures
derive that ID from the Linux boot ID; older captures remain supported in
single-file mode. Every Rank loads its own sibling `deps.json` and unique
`name_map*.json`, so the single-file override options are intentionally rejected
in directory mode.

L3 SceneTest runs create `rank<chip-worker>/d<local-capture>/` automatically and
invoke this directory mode after the case. Each new capture also contains
`dispatch_identity.json`. Members of one `submit_next_level_group` are paired by
their common `(run_id, task_slot)` even if their local `dN` suffixes differ; the
trace metadata records `dispatch_pairing: parent_dispatch_identity`. Old
captures and individually submitted per-Rank tasks fall back to symmetric `dN`
pairing and record `dispatch_pairing: local_capture_index`. A `dN` selector whose
sidecars identify different parent groups is rejected instead of producing a
plausible but incorrectly paired trace. This layout is scoped to one same-host
L3 Worker; NETWORK1/L4 needs an additional node namespace.

> Dependency arrows in the Perfetto trace come from `deps.json` (dep_gen
> replay). The device hot path no longer records fanout, so the typical
> workflow is **two runs**: a one-time `--enable-dep-gen` capture per
> topology to produce `deps.json`, then any number of
> `--enable-chip-swimlane` runs that consume it. If no `deps.json` is found
> alongside the perf JSON (and `--deps-json` isn't passed), the trace
> still renders but has no arrows; the converter prints a warning.

When neither `--func-names` nor `--kernel-config` is specified, the converter
loads a unique `name_map*.json` next to the input file. If that directory
contains multiple matching files, it prints a warning and uses default function
labels until one is selected explicitly with `--func-names`.

### SPMD dependency visualization

For SPMD logical tasks (`block_num > 1` in `deps.json`), dependency
arrows anchor on representative subtask rows on physical core lanes
(not a dedicated block-level track). SPMD tasks use the minimum-`core_id`
subtask row per `core_type` as the dependency anchor; MIX-type SPMD
tasks pick the minimum separately for AIC and AIV. See
[docs/dfx/chip-swimlane-profiling.md §3.5](../../docs/dfx/chip-swimlane-profiling.md#35-dependency-arrows-from-dep_gen).

Each logical `(pred, succ)` edge emits flows for the Cartesian product
of pred/succ anchor rows (`|pred_anchors| × |succ_anchors|`), not a
per-subtask crossbar.

SPMD lane labels append `_spmd` before `(rXtY)` unless the function
name already contains `spmd` (case-insensitive), e.g.
`v_proj_spmd(r2t10)` vs `SPMD_WRITE_AIV(t0)`.

With `-v`, the converter prints
`dependency arrows anchor on min core_id subtask per core_type` when
SPMD tasks are present.

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| `input` | | Input JSON file (chip_swimlane_records_*.json), **or** a `dfx_outputs` directory containing `rank*/dN/` for directory mode. If omitted, the latest file in outputs/ is used |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output JSON file (default: `merged_swimlane.json` beside a file input, `l3_swimlane.json` inside a directory input) |
| `--dispatch` | | Directory mode only: local capture directory to merge across Ranks, e.g. `d0`. Mutually exclusive with `--dispatch-id` |
| `--dispatch-id` | | Directory mode only: parent dispatch identity to merge, formatted `RUN_ID:TASK_SLOT`. Resolves each Rank's own `dN` through `dispatch_identity.json`. Mutually exclusive with `--dispatch` |
| `--kernel-config` | `-k` | Path to kernel_config.py, used for function name mapping. Rejected in directory mode |
| `--func-names` | | Path to name_map*.json (SceneTest format) for function name mapping. Rejected in directory mode |
| `--deps-json` | | Path to a dep_gen `deps.json` (defaults to sibling of input). Without one, no dependency arrows are drawn. Rejected in directory mode |
| `--overhead` | | Add the 8-line Overhead Analysis counter group (needs `deps.json`). See [sched-overhead-model](../../docs/dfx/sched-overhead-model.md). |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output |

Directory mode auto-loads each Rank's own sibling `name_map*.json` and
`deps.json`, which is why the three global override options above are rejected
there rather than silently applied to every Rank.

### Outputs

The tool produces three kinds of output:

#### 1. Perfetto JSON File

A Chrome Trace Event format JSON file that can be visualized in Perfetto:

- File location: `merged_swimlane.json` beside the input records file, or
  `l3_swimlane.json` inside the input `dfx_outputs` directory
- Open <https://ui.perfetto.dev/> and drag-and-drop the file to visualize

#### 2. Task Statistics

A statistics summary grouped by function (printed to the console), including Exec/Latency comparison and scheduling overhead analysis:

- **Exec**: kernel execution time on AICore (end_time - start_time)
- **Latency**: end-to-end latency from the AICPU perspective (finish_time - dispatch_time, including head OH + Exec + tail OH)
- **Head/Tail OH**: scheduling head/tail overhead
- **Exec_%**: Exec / Latency percentage (kernel utilization)

The table prints the source `chip_swimlane_level` recorded in
`chip_swimlane_records.json`. At level 1, only AICore timing is captured, so
Latency, Exec%, Head/Tail OH, and Propagation render as `-`, including total
latency in the TOTAL row. Count, Exec, and Local Setup remain available. The
`Total Test Time` line is omitted and replaced by an `AICore Observed Span`
summary. Level 2 and above retain the full latency summary.

#### 3. Scheduler Overhead Deep-Dive

`swimlane_converter` no longer runs the deep-dive inline — it needs the task DAG
(`deps.json`) from a *separate* `--enable-dep-gen` run, which can't be produced
accurately alongside the swimlane capture. Run
[`sched_overhead_analysis`](#sched_overhead_analysis) manually with both
artifacts to get the scheduler-starvation / critical-path report.

## sched_overhead_analysis

Answer **"is the scheduler the bottleneck, or is it starved?"** for either an
AICPU or AICore scheduler by
measuring, dependency- and MIX-aware, how much of the makespan a free core has
ready, undispatched work — vs. legitimately busy or dependency-limited. Full
model: [docs/dfx/sched-overhead-model.md](../../docs/dfx/sched-overhead-model.md).

### Overview

`sched_overhead_analysis` needs **two artifacts, captured in SEPARATE runs**
(co-running the flags perturbs timing — `dep_gen` adds per-submit overhead):

1. **Perf profiling data** (`chip_swimlane_records_*.json`, level >= 2) from a
   `--enable-chip-swimlane` run — per-task dispatch/start/end/finish. Level >= 3
   also supplies `scheduler_records` for the phase breakdown (legacy artifacts
   with `aicpu_scheduler_phases` remain readable).
2. **`deps.json`** (the task DAG) from a separate `--enable-dep-gen` run. It
   drives `ready(C) = max(producer.end)`, which is what separates scheduler
   bubbles from dependency stalls. **Required** — the tool errors without it.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Capture once (two separate runs of the same case):
pytest <case> --platform a2a3 --device N --enable-dep-gen        # -> deps.json
pytest <case> --platform a2a3 --device N --enable-chip-swimlane    # -> chip_swimlane_records.json (clean timing)

# Analyze:
python -m simpler_setup.tools.sched_overhead_analysis \
    --chip-swimlane-records-json outputs/<swimlane case>/chip_swimlane_records.json \
    --deps-json outputs/<dep_gen case>/deps.json
```

> `deps.json` is topology-invariant — capture it once per graph and reuse it for
> any number of swimlane runs. For Host / Device / Effective / Orch / Sched timing
> from a plain run, use [`strace_timing --rounds-table`](#strace_timing) instead.

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--chip-swimlane-records-json` | Path to the chip_swimlane_records_*.json file (level >= 2). If omitted, the latest under outputs/ is auto-selected. |
| `--deps-json` | Path to deps.json from a `--enable-dep-gen` run. **Required.** Falls back to a `deps.json` sibling of the perf JSON if present. |

### Outputs

Emitted in six parts:

- **Part 1: Overhead verdict** — per-engine overhead (idle T-core *and* a ready, undispatched T-task, MIX-aware) + system `all_overhead` / `has_overhead`, all as % of makespan. An engine with no ready work is not overhead (dependency-mandated idle, not waste).
- **Part 2: aicore switch** — the pre-dispatched pickup gap (`dispatch < prev_end`), reported **per core** (min/mean/max, ~0.8 µs each), the overhead-vs-independent split, and the makespan switch bound `[min over cores, sum of per-engine minima]`.
- **Part 3 / 4: Head / Tail OH distributions** — P10–P99 + mean + total (per-task pickup and detect-latency magnitude).
- **Part 5: Scheduler phase breakdown** — Level >= 3 reports the producer's phases. AICPU includes per-thread loop, queue-pop, fanout/fanin, and tail-vs-loop metrics; AICore reports its bootstrap/fanin/ready/dispatch/complete/refill/resolve/idle phase totals without applying AICPU-only queue formulas. At Level 2 this section is explicitly marked unavailable while Parts 1–4 and 6 remain available.
- **Part 6: Critical-path latency attribution** — along the makespan path, scheduler-injected µs vs compute µs ("scheduler adds X% to the critical path").

The common dependency-aware analysis works at chip_swimlane_level >= 2 for
both scheduler producers. Capture level >= 3 when phase attribution is needed.

---

## strace_timing

Per-stage breakdown of every `simpler_run()` from `[STRACE]` host-trace
markers in a log (host stderr or CANN device log). The runtime emits one
`[STRACE]` line per span on scope exit (RAII, gated on `SIMPLER_HOST_STRACE`,
`LOG_TIMING`), including the AICPU device-phase subdivision (`clk=dev`). See
[docs/dfx/host-trace.md](../../docs/dfx/host-trace.md) for the marker grammar.

```bash
# Per-callable TPOT table (decode = most-invoked hid bucket; prefill = once-seen)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.strace_timing path/to/log

# Per-round Host/Device/Orch/Sched table (the benchmark/--rounds N view)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.strace_timing path/to/log --rounds-table

# Indented nested span tree per callable (chip.run → bind / runner_run →
# device_wall → preamble/config_validate/arena_wire/sm_reset/orch/sched/post_orch)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.strace_timing path/to/log --tree

# Also emit a Chrome-trace / Perfetto JSON (one named lane per invocation, with
# separate host and device(clk=dev) tracks; nested by span containment)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.strace_timing path/to/log --trace-out strace.json

# L3/L4 host scheduler timeline (real OS pid/tid lanes + cross-thread flows)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.strace_timing path/to/log --swimlane host_swimlane.json
```

Groups spans by `(pid, inv)`, rebuilds each invocation's tree from `depth`,
buckets by callable hash `hid`, and reports each callable's mean `chip.run`
plus per-stage means. It reads the host-emitted `[STRACE]` lines and shows the
host stages (`bind`/`runner_run`/`validate`) alongside the AICPU phases.

`--tree` renders one nested span tree per callable; each node's duration is the
**median across every invocation** of that callable (not one invocation's
value). This matters for a callable whose invocations differ in cost — e.g.
qwen3 decode, where the pypto-serving profile warmup dispatches a tiny-KV step
(seq_len≈257, ~28 ms) before the real 3.5k-context steps (~40 ms); a
single-invocation tree would report the warmup value.

`--rounds-table` renders one row per invocation of the busiest `hid` —
**Host** always, plus every device column whose marker is present, in the format
`tools/benchmark_rounds.sh` parses. TMR normally supplies Device / Effective /
Orch / Sched. HBG supplies Device but no device-side orch/sched windows, so its
table contains Host / Device only. `Effective` is the TMR orch∪sched merged
window (`max(orch_end,sched_end) − min(orch_start,sched_start)`, the old
device-log "Total"), recomputed from the orch/sched markers' `ts`+`dur` — no
device log needed. The scene test only *emits* the markers to stderr; tee a run
to a file (`python test_*.py … --rounds N > run.log 2>&1`) and pass `run.log`
here. Because grouping is per `(pid, inv)`, this captures **L3 multi-round**
(every chip-child invocation), not just round 0.

`--swimlane` consumes the `<level>.*` host-scheduler markers (`host.`,
`network1.`, `network2.`, `network3.`) and child `chip.run` markers, plus any
`ext.<producer>.*` spans a producer outside simpler emitted. Host lanes retain
their OS pid/tid. Because Chrome Trace
JSON has one visible timestamp axis, raw device-domain `clk=dev` slices are
stored in the top-level `unalignedDeviceSpans` array rather than placed beside
the unrelated host clock and stretching Perfetto into an empty-looking
multi-day viewport. Their ns timestamps remain unchanged; no clock offset is
invented. This does not alter the established per-invocation `--trace-out`
view.

The swimlane is the only view that renders `ext.` spans: every table and
`--trace-out` keys on `(pid, inv)`, which no external producer has. See
[docs/dfx/host-trace.md](../../docs/dfx/host-trace.md) for that contract.

---

## hbg_bind_phases

Per-segment statistics for `host_build_graph`'s **`bind` stage** from the
`chip.run.bind.<segment>` `[STRACE]` spans a run emits under
`SIMPLER_HBG_BIND_BREAKDOWN_ENABLE=1`. One span per segment per bind; see
[docs/dfx/hbg-bind-phases.md](../../docs/dfx/hbg-bind-phases.md) for
what the segments are, the invocation that produces them, and how to compare two
runs.

```bash
# min / median / max per segment over the warm binds, plus the control-plane total
python -m simpler_setup.tools.hbg_bind_phases path/to/log
python -m simpler_setup.tools.hbg_bind_phases outputs/<case>_<ts>/    # a directory of host.*.log
```

**A bind is one `(pid, inv)`.** A span carries both, so grouping needs no rank
count, no round count and no inference from emission order — concurrent ranks
writing one stream separate by pid, and each bind by the run epoch its
`chip.run.bind` allocated. `--keep-first` keeps the cold binds; by default the
earliest bind of each pid is dropped as warm-up, which is exactly one per rank.
A run whose every bind is a rank's warm-up is refused rather than reported, since
the one number it could print is the cold one.

Two rules stay encoded rather than left to the caller, because each silently
produces a wrong number: the control-plane total is summed **within** a bind
before any minimum is taken, and the first bind of each rank is warm-up.

A run whose control plane is missing a segment entirely — a change can retire one
— is still totalled, over the segments it has, with the absent ones named. A
segment missing from only *some* binds means those binds lost records, and they
are excluded with a warning. If the log's first line is a `[stamp]` line naming the
command and commit, it is echoed above the table. Distinct
`torch_backend_autoload` records are printed alongside it. Missing stamps or
autoload records produce an explicit comparison warning.

---

## phase_time_split

The same segment spans, read for a different question: was a segment
**running** or **waiting**? A duration cannot say, and the answer decides where to
look next — an on-CPU segment is split further by its fault count and by the
syscalls inside its window, while an off-CPU one is a wait, and `nvcsw` versus
`nivcsw` suggests whether the waiting was blocking or losing the CPU to a loaded box.
Both come from `RUSAGE_SELF` and so count the whole process, recorders included, which
is why they suggest rather than decide.

```bash
python -m simpler_setup.tools.phase_time_split path/to/log
python -m simpler_setup.tools.phase_time_split path/to/log --phase host_orch
```

`cpu` is the bind thread's own CPU time, so `dur - cpu` is what it spent off CPU.
`reccpu` is every Graph recording worker's summed, so `rec/dur` is how many threads'
worth of work ran alongside — a concurrency ratio, not a share of the wall. One
recorder busy for the whole segment reads about 1, partial overlap reads below it, and
only aggregate recorder CPU exceeding one wall-time interval — two or more busy at
once — pushes it above 1. `reccpu` and `tminflt` need Linux
(`pthread_getcpuclockid`, `getrusage(RUSAGE_THREAD)`); on a log from a macOS `*sim`
build they are 0 because they cannot be sampled, not because nothing ran.

Cold and warm binds are reported as separate rows rather than the cold one being
dropped: a cold bind pays the one-off cost of standing recorder storage and the arenas
up, and its size is the thing worth knowing when the goal is to move that cost to
`Worker.init()`.

Times come from per-thread CPU clocks, in nanoseconds. rusage times are not used:
`ru_utime`/`ru_stime` are accounted per scheduler tick, 10 ms at `CLK_TCK=100`, so on a
segment of a millisecond they quantise to either zero or a whole tick — plausible
one at a time, noise in aggregate. A log written before the clocks existed is refused
rather than reported as all-on-CPU. See
[docs/dfx/hbg-bind-phases.md](../../docs/dfx/hbg-bind-phases.md) for the field table.

## deps_viewer

Render the dep_gen `deps.json` task graph as either grep-friendly text
(default) or a self-contained pan/zoom HTML page. Pairs naturally with
[`swimlane_converter`](#swimlane_converter): swimlane is the timing view,
this is the structural view.

### Overview

`deps_viewer` reads `deps.json` produced by the dep_gen replay (see
[docs/dfx/dep-gen.md](../../docs/dfx/dep-gen.md)) and supports two modes:

- **Default text mode** — emits `deps_viewer.txt` with:
  - `SUMMARY` (input path plus task / edge / tensor counts)
    - `tasks`: number of rendered task ids
    - `unique_task_edges`: number of unique `(pred, succ)` pairs
    - `annotated_edges`: total number of annotated edge rows
    - `perf_sidecar`: `yes` when `chip_swimlane_records.json` was successfully loaded
    - `func_name_map`: `yes` when at least one task name resolved to a named
      `func_name` from `--func-names` or an auto-discovered `name_map*.json`.
      `func_name_map` stays `no` unless a real human-readable name was resolved.
  - `TASK INDEX` (one line per task for grep)
    - `kind=` distinguishes `submit` / `dummy` / `alloc` / `unknown`
    - `func_id=` is taken only from `tasks[].kernel_ids` and shows the aligned
      three-slot `[aic,aiv0,aiv1]` array for `submit`
    - `kind=alloc` / `kind=dummy` render as `func_id=none`
  - `TASK DETAILS` (per-task `FANIN` / `FANOUT` blocks showing peer task references only)
  Best for "what does task X depend on?" and large-graph debugging.
- **`--format html`** — renders the task graph as Graphviz SVG wrapped in a
  self-contained HTML file viewable in any modern browser.
  - Add `--show-tensor-info` to restore per-task tensor rows and edge routing
    to specific arg ports in the HTML view.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Auto-pick the newest deps.json under ./outputs/ -> deps_viewer.txt
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer

# Specific path -> deps_viewer.txt next to deps.json
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json

# Explicit text output path
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json -o graph.txt

# HTML output
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --format html -o graph.html

# HTML output with per-task tensor details and arg-port routing
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --format html --show-tensor-info -o graph.html

# Force-directed HTML layout for large graphs (>~1000 nodes)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --format html --engine sfdp

# Override task labels with a func_id -> name mapping
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --func-names outputs/<case>_<ts>/name_map_TestPA_basic.json

# Transitive reduction: select non-redundant edges, print what was removed
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --edge-mode reduced

# Redundant-only: select the transitively-implied edges reduced would drop
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --edge-mode omitted

# Dataflow-verified view: preserve OUTPUT_EXISTING reuse boundaries and require
# direct TensorMap dataflow around every byte of an omitted INOUT
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --edge-mode omitted_dataflow
```

`--edge-mode` selects which structural `(pred, succ)` edges are visible:

- `full` (default) — every dependency edge.
- `reduced` — the transitively-reduced scheduling edge set: an `explicit` or
  `tensormap` edge already implied by a longer path is dropped, e.g. `A->C`
  when `A->B->C` exists. A `creator` edge is always retained because it keeps
  the task that owns a tensor referenced by the consumer alive; execution order
  alone cannot replace that lifetime relationship.
- `omitted` — only the redundant edges `reduced` would drop (its complement),
  for auditing exactly which dependencies are transitively covered.
- `reduced_dataflow` — structural reduction only selects candidate edges; it
  does not reduce the annotations used for proof. Every candidate is checked
  against the complete original `creator` and `tensormap` annotations before
  display filtering. An `OUTPUT_EXISTING` creator edge is always preserved as a
  possible reuse-generation boundary. An `INOUT` creator edge is omitted only
  when direct `tensormap` annotations prove that every occupied byte flows from
  an earlier Output and continues to a later `INOUT` owned by the same creator.
  Regions are derived from the underlying `buffer_addr`, dtype, shape, start
  offset, and strides. Missing, ambiguous, or excessively complex metadata is
  preserved conservatively.
- `omitted_dataflow` — only structurally redundant edges that pass the
  dataflow proof; the complement of `reduced_dataflow`.

All reduction modes print the redundant edges to stdout as a
`<task> -> <task>` list, where each task uses the same label as the rendered
graph — the bare `local` counter when every task is in ring 0, or the explicit
`(ring, local)` tuple once any task lives in ring >= 1. Text output emits only
the selected edge set. HTML output keeps every edge in the Graphviz layout and
colors unselected edges like the page background, so `reduced` / `omitted`
preserve the full-graph node placement and routing while showing only the
selected edge set. Selected edges are drawn above background-colored edges so
they stay visible where routes overlap. When `-o` is omitted the graph is
written to a mode-specific stem (`deps_viewer_reduced.*` /
`deps_viewer_omitted.*`) rather than `deps_viewer.*` so it never clobbers a
full-graph render in the same directory. In `reduced` / `omitted`, any
annotation with `source=creator` protects that `(pred, succ)` pair from
reduction. The dataflow modes use the complete original annotations to prove
the narrow exception described above. Reduction is skipped with a warning if
the graph contains a cycle.

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| `input` | | Path to `deps.json` (default: newest under `./outputs/`) |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output path; default stem is `deps_viewer`, or `deps_viewer_{mode}` for any reduction mode |
| `--format` | | Output format: `text` (default) or `html` |
| `--edge-mode` | | Select visible edges: `full`, `reduced`, `omitted`, `reduced_dataflow`, or `omitted_dataflow`; HTML preserves full layout. |
| `--engine` | | HTML-only Graphviz layout engine: `dot` (default), `sfdp`, `neato`, `fdp`, `circo`, `twopi` |
| `--direction` | | HTML-only flow direction for hierarchical layouts: `LR` (default) / `TB` / `BT` / `RL` |
| `--show-tensor-info` | | HTML-only: render per-task tensor rows and route edges to specific arg ports |
| `--func-names` | | JSON file with `callable_id_to_name` (or flat `{func_id: name}`) for task-label enrichment |

### Dependencies

Text output has no extra dependencies. HTML output requires Graphviz on PATH:

```bash
brew install graphviz    # macOS
apt install graphviz     # Debian/Ubuntu
```

The HTML viewer is self-contained — no JavaScript or fonts are downloaded
at view time.

### Browser controls

- **drag** → pan
- **scroll / two-finger swipe** → pan
- **Ctrl+scroll / trackpad pinch** → zoom about cursor
- **f** → fit to view
- **r** → reset to 1:1

## dump_viewer

Inspect and export args captured by the runtime args-dump feature.
See [docs/args-dump.md](../../docs/dfx/args-dump.md) for the full capture workflow;
this section only documents CLI invocation.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# List all args (auto-picks latest outputs/*/args_dump dir)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.dump_viewer

# Filter by task/stage/role
python -m simpler_setup.tools.dump_viewer --task 0x0000000200000a00 --stage before --role input

# Export the current selection to txt
python -m simpler_setup.tools.dump_viewer --task 0x0000000200000a00 --stage before --role input --export

# Export a specific arg by index (always exports)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.dump_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/args_dump/ --index 42
```

## wait_reduction_sim

Measure how many redundant WAIT edges the `tensormap_and_ringbuffer`
runtime's bounded reachability bitmap reduction would remove from a real
dependency graph, against the exact full-DAG transitive reduction as the
upper bound (issue #1376 acceptance #9). Decides the production bitmap
window (BL) from data instead of guesswork.

### Overview

`wait_reduction_sim` reads the same `deps.json` the
[`deps_viewer`](#deps_viewer) consumes (edges are as-constructed, i.e.
pre-reduction, so one capture serves baseline and comparison alike). It
reconstructs the global submission order from the `tasks[]` record order,
OR-accumulates edge flags per `(pred, succ)` pair, and runs two models over
the WAIT subgraph:

- **Full reduction** — exact transitive reachability over the whole DAG:
  the upper bound any reducer could reach.
- **Online bitmap** — a faithful mirror of the runtime's
  `reduce_wait_edges` (frozen per-task `R[t]`, two-pass `direct`/`via`
  fold, `d > BL` window misses kept) at each requested window size.

The report includes per-BL removal counts, `WAIT|RETAIN → RETAIN` demotions
vs pure WAIT drops, window and cross-ring misses, and the producer→consumer
submission-distance CDF. `DepGenRecord` does not preserve explicit
dependency kinds yet (#1827), so removal counts are accurate while the report
marks affected demote-vs-drop classifications as uncertain.

> **`estimated_dep_pool_entries_removed` and
> `estimated_readiness_fanout_nodes_removed` are edge-count upper bounds, not
> runtime savings.** Both equal the removed-edge count, i.e. they assume one
> removed edge frees one dependency-pool entry. On-device counting shows about
> 90% of removed edges point at producers that are already
> `CHIP_TASK_COMPLETED` when the consumer is wired; those take the
> `completed_fanin` branch and never call `dep_pool.prepend`, so they free no
> entry. On a DeepSeek-V4 decode step these two columns overstate the measured
> saving by roughly 10x (990 of 19,114 entries actually saved, −5.2%). The
> *edge* counts are sound — that step's pure-drop count matched the prediction
> exactly and the total was within 6%. Full measurement in
> [`docs/investigations/2026-09-wait-reduction-bitmap-window-sizing.md`](../../docs/investigations/2026-09-wait-reduction-bitmap-window-sizing.md).

### Usage

```bash
# Capture once (dep_gen records pre-construction edges; see docs/dfx/dep-gen.md)
pytest examples/a5/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/qwen3_14b_decode --platform a5 --enable-dep-gen

# Compare BL=64/128/256 (default) against the upper bound
python -m simpler_setup.tools.wait_reduction_sim outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json

# Machine-readable output, e.g. to diff two captures
python -m simpler_setup.tools.wait_reduction_sim deps_a.json deps_b.json --json report.json
```

Reading the output: when `BL=64 removed ≈ upper_bound`, the single-word
window already saturates the graph's redundancy and larger windows buy
nothing; when the `pct_pairs_within_window` column is well below 100 for a
BL, the graph has far-apart producer/consumer pairs that only a wider
window could cover.

A low `removed / upper_bound` ratio is **not** on its own a case for widening:
check `cross_ring_misses` first. Qwen3-14B decode removes 1 of 40 redundant
edges at BL=64 and the same 1 at BL=256, because 39 of its misses are
cross-ring long edges that no window in this range reaches. Only
`pct_pairs_within_window` being the binding constraint argues for a wider BL —
see the [investigation entry](../../docs/investigations/2026-09-wait-reduction-bitmap-window-sizing.md)
for the BL=64/128/256 comparison and why BL=64 is the shipped choice.

## Shared Configuration

### Input File Format

The analysis tools share the same input format - the `chip_swimlane_records_*.json` files generated by the simpler runtime:

```json
{
  "chip_swimlane_level": 4,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": 0,
      "func_id": 0,
      "core_id": 7,
      "core_type": "aiv",
      "ring_id": 0,
      "start_time_us": 47.46,
      "end_time_us": 55.9,
      "duration_us": 8.44,
      "dispatch_time_us": 45.94,
      "finish_time_us": 60.52
    },
    {
      "task_id": 4294967296,
      "func_id": 1,
      "core_id": 7,
      "core_type": "aiv",
      "ring_id": 1,
      "start_time_us": 68.68,
      "end_time_us": 70.42,
      "duration_us": 1.74,
      "dispatch_time_us": 68.24,
      "finish_time_us": 71.2
    }
  ]
}
```

Dependency edges come from `deps.json` (dep_gen replay) at post-process time —
not from the perf JSON. See [`swimlane_converter --deps-json`](#swimlane_converter).

Top-level layout depends on `chip_swimlane_level`:

- All levels: `chip_swimlane_level`, `tasks[]` (per-task fields above).
- A5 HBG `>= 2`: also `aicpu_lifecycle_records[]`; the converter renders the
  real handshake, topology/configuration, context-publication, bootstrap-wait,
  register-release, and exit timestamps under `AICPU Lifecycle`.
- `>= 3`: also `scheduler_records.streams[]`. Every Record has the common
  `start_cycles`, `end_cycles`, `loop_iter`, `kind`, `tasks_processed`, and
  nullable `task_id` fields. Stream metadata selects the AICPU or AICore
  interpretation; producer-specific counters live in `metrics[]`.
- `>= 4`: also `aicpu_orchestrator_phases[]` (per-task orchestrator
  phase records).

### Kernel Config Format

To display meaningful function names in the output, provide a `kernel_config.py` file:

```python
KERNELS = [
    {
        "func_id": 0,
        "name": "QK",
        # ... other fields
    },
    {
        "func_id": 1,
        "name": "SF",
        # ... other fields
    },
]
```

The tools extract the `func_id` to `name` mapping from the `KERNELS` list.

## Tool Selection Guide

### Use swimlane_converter when you need

- A detailed timeline execution view
- To analyze task scheduling across different cores
- To see precise execution times and intervals
- Task execution statistics
- Professional performance analysis and optimization

### Use deps_viewer when you need

- A structural view of task dependencies (who feeds whom)
- Fast grep-friendly inspection via the default text output
- A single-file HTML you can open offline and pan by dragging or scrolling;
  use Ctrl+scroll or trackpad pinch to zoom
- Optional per-task tensor rows and arg-port routing in HTML via
  `--show-tensor-info`
- A graph that survives without an associated timing run (deps.json is
  produced by structural replay, not by hardware profiling)

### Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run the test to produce both timing + structural data
pytest tests/st/... --enable-chip-swimlane --enable-dep-gen

# 2. Perfetto timeline (automatic via SceneTest)
# -> outputs/<case>_<ts>/merged_swimlane.json
#    open at https://ui.perfetto.dev/

# 3. Structural dependency graph (manual, default text output)
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json
# -> outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps_viewer.txt

# 4. Same graph as HTML
python -m simpler_setup.tools.deps_viewer outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps.json \
    --format html -o outputs/<case>_<ts>/deps_viewer.html

```

For batch-run hardware regression, see the dev-only script
[`tools/benchmark_rounds.sh`](../../tools/benchmark_rounds.sh).

## Troubleshooting

### Error: cannot find chip_swimlane_records_*.json file

- Make sure the test was run with the `--enable-chip-swimlane` flag
- Check that the outputs/ directory exists and contains profiling data

### Warning: Kernel entry missing 'func_id' or 'name'

- Check the kernel_config.py file format
- Make sure every KERNELS entry has a 'func_id' and 'name' field

### Error: Unsupported chip_swimlane_level

- The tools accept chip_swimlane_level 1–4 (the integer captured at runtime
  via `--enable-chip-swimlane <N>`)
- Regenerate the profiling data with a supported level

### Error: Perf JSON missing required fields for scheduler overhead analysis

- This error means the input `chip_swimlane_records_*.json` lacks fields required by the deep-dive analysis (typically `dispatch_time_us` / `finish_time_us`)
- The basic conversion in `swimlane_converter` can still succeed, but the deep-dive will be skipped or fail
- Remediation:
  1. Re-run with `--enable-chip-swimlane` to produce a new `outputs/*/chip_swimlane_records.json`
  2. Re-run `swimlane_converter` or `sched_overhead_analysis`
  3. Verify that each task in the JSON contains `dispatch_time_us` and `finish_time_us`

### `deps_viewer` complains that Graphviz `dot` is not on PATH

- This only affects `--format html`
- Install graphviz: `brew install graphviz` (macOS) or `apt install graphviz` (Debian/Ubuntu)
- Verify with `which dot`; should print a path
- Use a different layout engine with `--engine sfdp` for very large graphs
