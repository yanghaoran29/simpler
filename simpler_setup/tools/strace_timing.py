"""Parse simpler host-side trace markers (``[STRACE]``) into per-stage timing.

The host runtime emits one ``[STRACE]`` line per span on scope exit (RAII
markers in ``src/common/log/include/common/strace.h``), gated by the
compile-time ``SIMPLER_HOST_STRACE`` macro (on by default) and emitted at
``LOG_TIMING``. Device-domain phases (AICPU subdivision of the on-NPU wall)
are emitted by the host after readback as ``clk=dev`` spans nested under
``chip.run.runner_run.device_wall``.

Runtimes emit only the device spans they implement. Both current runtimes emit
``device_wall``; the finer orch/sched phase subdivision is TMR-specific.

Marker grammar (matched anywhere on the line, so the CANN/host log prefix is
ignored)::

    [STRACE] v=1 pid=<n> tid=<n> inv=<n> hid=<hex> depth=<n> name=<dotted> ts=<ns> dur=<ns> [k=v ...]

Grouping:
    * ``(pid, inv)`` identifies one ``simpler_run`` invocation — all its spans
      share these. ``inv`` is a process-wide id (atomic-allocated, so unique even
      across concurrent calls), NOT a token index.
    * ``hid`` is the callable's content hash (stable across slot reuse / runs).
      The most-frequently-seen hid bucket is the decode callable (one
      invocation per token); a once-seen hid is prefill.
    * ``depth`` rebuilds the call tree per invocation (no timestamp-containment
      guessing): a span at depth d is a child of the most recent span at d-1.

Outputs:
    * a per-callable TPOT table (each invocation's chip.run dur + the mean
      of each sub-stage across invocations), and
    * optionally a Chrome-trace / Perfetto JSON (``--trace-out``): one ``ph:"X"``
      event per span on a synthetic per-invocation lane, so each host call tree
      renders as nested slices; host events also carry wall time when the log
      contains a matching ``CLOCK_ANCHOR``, or
    * a host scheduler swimlane (``--swimlane``) whose lanes are the real OS
      pid/tid, except that a thread which interleaved runs is split into one lane
      per pipeline slot so each lane reads as a sequence; cross-thread handoffs
      are Chrome flow events and host events carry matching anchor wall time.
