"""l0_swimlane — generate an AICore intra-core swimlane trace.json for a task.

Given a SceneTest test file + platform + a comma-list of func_ids (the mix
member set), this tool:
  1. runs (or reuses) a JSON-only args dump (`--dump-args 3`) to capture the
     task's real per-arg metadata,
  2. picks the task whose active-subtask set == `--func-id` and reconstructs its
     FULL positional args[] (shapes / dtypes / strides / start_offset / scalar
     values) from the #1181 dump; the task's func_id ARRAY is its mix membership,
  3. generates the "intra-core replay" workspace — a single combined
     `replay_entry` whose cube sub-core runs the AIC member and vec sub-core(s)
     the AIV member, so a MIX task replays AS ONE OP (msprof op simulator recipe
     from .claude/skills/insight-trace/SKILL.md),
  4. smoke-builds it, then runs `msprof op simulator` and exports the task's
     trace.json (a combined AIC+AIV swimlane for a mix).

Mix support: any mix (same- or different-source members) replays as one task.
`--func-id` IS the member set — name the task's FULL set: `--func-id 0` traces
a task the orchestration dispatches on its own (a single-core task {0}),
`--func-id 0,1,2` traces a 3-way mix in full. The author wrote the
orchestration, so the member set is known directly — there is no shape-guessing.
LIMITATION
(tier C): cross-core synchronisation that the orchestration drove (task deps /
barriers) is absent in this isolated replay, so inter-core waits are optimistic
— the per-core pipeline structure is faithful, the AIC<->AIV handoff timing is
not. 2-AIV mixes (e.g. func_id 0,1,2) route per AIV lane via the hardware
get_subblockid(); validated on the a2a3sim camodel (the two AIV lanes run
different kernels, e.g. VADD vs VMUL).

Usage (onboard — recommended; wrap the whole tool in one task-submit so the dump
and the camodel collect share the locked device):
    task-submit --device auto --run \
        "python -m simpler_setup.tools.l0_swimlane \
            --test tests/st/a2a3/.../test_paged_attention_unroll.py \
            --func-id 0 --platform a2a3 --case <small case>"

Both the dump (when `--platform` is onboard) and the msprof collect step need an
NPU device context. Run the tool under a single outer task-submit: it appends
--device <id> to this command (also exported as $TASK_DEVICE); that one device
threads through both the dump and the collect, so neither grabs a second lock.
With a sim `--platform` (a2a3sim/a5sim) the dump needs no NPU, and the collect
self-locks via its own task-submit. Requires ASCEND_HOME_PATH (source CANN
set_env.sh first).

# --- SPMD context + mix detection (no per-test markers needed) --------------
# SPMD kernels read an execution context at args slots 48/49 —
# LocalContext{block_idx, block_num} (48) and GlobalContext{sub_block_id} (49) —
# which the orchestration builds per dispatch. l0_swimlane runs an isolated
# replay (no orchestration), so it SYNTHESIZES that context host-side. None of
# its inputs need a per-test marker; they are all derived:
#   * is-mix      — a cooperative mix kernel is the SAME source compiled for both
#                   sub-cores, so it appears as an (aic, aiv) incore PAIR sharing
#                   one source. Detected by load_kernel_meta; everything else
#                   (incl. independent kernels packed into a mix dispatch, like
#                   mixed_example) goes through the AIC/AIV-only path.
#   * hw_block_dim / block_num — the case's `block_dim` (the SPMD grid width).
#   * aiv_lanes_per_block      — the arch's hardware subblockdim (ARCH_CONFIG).
# The mix path additionally needs ONE incore to declare the full tensor
# `signature` (so the dump captures the shared args) — a standard CALLABLE
# field, not a tool-specific one.

      for a 1-AIV mix, but the faithful behavior for an SPMD mix whose two AIV
      lanes legitimately run the same kernel (a duplicate func_id collapsed
      above), each lane differing only by `get_subblockid()`.

    * **B-tier (2 AIV)** — still ONE translation unit, but the two AIV `.cpp`
      share file-scope names (`static get_num_tiles`, `extern "C" kernel_entry`),
      so each `#include` is wrapped in `#define`-renames + `#undef`
      (`kernel_entry`->`l0_f<id>_entry`, `get_num_tiles`->`l0_f<id>_get_num_tiles`).
      Both AIV includes sit under `#if defined(__DAV_VEC__)` so the vector ISA
      target feature is in scope (an un-guarded include compiles for the wrong
      arch — that is why separate compilation failed). `replay_entry` routes per
      sub-core, and per AIV lane via `get_subblockid()`.

    NOTE (tier C, PLAN §3.4): cross-core sync the orchestration drove is absent
    in this isolated replay, so inter-core waits are optimistic.
